  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Indeed, Seattle, WA</h3>
  <p>At Indeed, I evolved from individual contributor to engineering manager and back to senior IC, gaining valuable leadership experience while deepening my technical expertise. After successfully managing a 6-person engineering team for two years, I made the strategic decision to return to hands-on technical work, driven by the personal satisfaction I derive from direct problem-solving, my desire to maximize impact through technical contribution, and my eagerness to learn new domains. This transition allowed me to pivot into frontend platform engineering, where I could apply my leadership skills while building critical infrastructure used across the entire organization.</p>
