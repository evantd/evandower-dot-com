**Phase:** 6 — Parent Sustainability  
**Duration:** 2 weeks (this is a practice step, not a one-time skill)

---

## The One Thing

> **This step, you learn the difference between a request and a demand — and start making true requests.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. Just ask yourself: "If they said no, would I punish, guilt-trip, or withdraw?" If yes, it was a demand.

> **Remember the order:**
> 1. Check brain states — flooded or receptive? (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first, name & validate feelings (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: this step's tool

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Model requests (not demands) | Throughout day |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Replace one demand with a true request | Once daily |
| **3. Environment** | Create a "request board" visual | 15-20 min once |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Before speaking, ask yourself: "Am I okay if they say no?"
- **1-2 minutes:** Catch one demand, restate it as a request
- **15-20 minutes once this step:** Create the visual request board

If you are totally fried: **Only do the 10-second check.** Just notice the difference between your requests and demands. That alone is a win for this step.

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** (Track 2 is the most transformative) and call it a win.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 15 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

**Demands trigger the downstairs brain.** When a child perceives a threat (and "do this or else" IS a threat), their fight/flight/freeze response activates. Their upstairs brain — the part that can cooperate, think flexibly, and problem-solve — goes offline.

Commands trigger resistance. True requests invite cooperation.

> "A request becomes a demand when the listener believes they will be punished or blamed for not complying."

This isn't about being permissive. You still have boundaries (Step 10). But the *way* you ask determines whether you get cooperation or resistance.

### What This Changes

Once you internalize the request/demand distinction:
- Daily friction decreases (you're not constantly triggering resistance)
- Kids feel more respected (and become more cooperative)
- You stop the power-struggle cycle
- Your 6-year-old learns how to ask for what she needs (not demand)
- Everyone's nervous system stays calmer

### The Core Insight from NVC

> "The objective of NVC is not to change people and their behavior in order to get our way; it is to establish relationships based on honesty and empathy that will eventually fulfill everyone's needs."

**Connection is more important than compliance.** When you make true requests, you're prioritizing the relationship.

> **Buddhist Lens (Optional):** A true request is *non-attached* — you want a yes AND you're okay with a no. In Buddhist terms, you're releasing grasping at a particular outcome and staying with your values instead. You commit to the *effort* (showing up, connecting, asking skillfully) while letting go of *control* over how they respond. This is wise effort, not passivity. See [Buddhist Lens](/parenting/companions/buddhist-lens/) for more.

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Modeling Requests (Not Demands)

This is primarily **parent modeling**. Your children learn to make requests by hearing you make them. At 2, they're absorbing your tone and patterns. At 6, they can start understanding the concept explicitly.

### The Request Criteria

A true request has four qualities:

1. **Positive** — What you WANT, not what you don't want
2. **Specific** — Concrete, observable action
3. **Present moment** — Something doable now
4. **Genuinely okay with "no"** — No punishment follows refusal

### The Critical Test

**How do you react when they say no?**

| Your Reaction to "No" | What It Was |
|----------------------|-------------|
| You punish, withdraw, or guilt-trip | It was a demand |
| You're curious about their needs, negotiate | It was a request |

### Demand → Request Transformations

| Demand (Triggers Resistance) | Request (Invites Cooperation) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Clean up NOW." | "Would you be willing to put the blocks away before dinner?" |
| "Say sorry!" | "I'd like you to check if she's okay. Would you do that?" |
| "Stop crying." | "I hear you're upset. Can I sit with you?" |
| "Get your shoes on!" | "We're leaving in two minutes. Can you get your shoes?" |
| "Eat your vegetables." | "Would you try one bite of the broccoli?" |
| "Be quiet!" | "I need quiet right now. Can you use a whisper voice?" |
| "Share with your sister!" | "Would you be willing to let her have a turn when you're done?" |

### Age-Specific Modeling

| Age | What They Can Learn | How to Model |
|-----|---------------------|--------------|
| **2yo Twins** | Absorbing tone and pattern; learning "Would you like to...?" | Use request language; they'll hear it hundreds of times before they use it |
| **6yo** | Can understand the concept explicitly | "I'm asking, not telling. You can say no, and we'll figure something out." |

**For your 6-year-old specifically:**

After you make a request, you can name it:
- "That was a request, not a demand. You can say yes, no, or suggest something else."
- "I'm asking because I want you to want to help, not because you have to."

When she demands something, coach gently:
- "That sounded like a demand. Can you try asking?"
- "[6-year-old], I want to say yes to you. It's easier when you ask instead of tell."

### When She Demands from the Twins

This is a natural opportunity:
- "Sounds like you're telling [twin] what to do. She might cooperate more if you ask."
- "Try 'Would you...' instead of 'Give me...'"

### ND Adaptation

**For PDA profiles:**
- PDA kids **especially** need requests, not demands
- Any perceived demand triggers automatic resistance (it's neurological, not defiance)
- Frame everything as choice: "Would you like to... or...?"
- Accept unconventional "yes" responses (a grunt, a nod, doing it 5 minutes later)

**For sensory/processing differences:**
- Give processing time after requests (5-10 seconds of silence)
- One request at a time, not stacked
- Visual cues can help (point, gesture, picture)

**For your 6-year-old:**
- She may need even more autonomy than typical
- Offer "no" as a valid option, then problem-solve together
- "You can say no. And then we'll figure out what to do about [the underlying need]."

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: One Request Per Day

**Time:** 1-2 minutes, once per day  
**Goal:** Replace ONE daily demand with a true request

### The Practice

1. **Notice** a moment when you're about to give a command
2. **Pause** for half a second
3. **Transform** the demand into a request
4. **Check** your genuine willingness to hear "no"

### Start with Low-Stakes Situations

Don't start with the hardest moments. Start with requests where you really ARE okay with "no":

**Good starting points:**
- "Would you like to help set the table?" (genuinely okay if no)
- "Can you bring me the napkins?" (not urgent)
- "Would you be willing to pick up these two toys?" (small ask)

### The Daily Challenge

Pick one recurring demand from your day. Transform it:

| Typical Demand | Transform To |
|----------------|--------------|
| Morning: "Get dressed!" | "Would you be willing to get dressed before breakfast, or after?" |
| Mealtime: "Eat your food." | "Can you try two bites?" |
| Transition: "Put that down, we're leaving!" | "We're leaving in one minute. Can you find a stopping place?" |
| Cleanup: "Clean up now." | "Would you be willing to put the crayons away?" |
| Bedtime: "Go brush your teeth." | "It's teeth time. Want me to come with you or will you go yourself?" |

### What Happens When They Say No

This is where it gets real. If they say no:

**DON'T:**
- Punish, lecture, or guilt-trip (then it was a demand)
- Immediately escalate ("Fine, THEN no screen time!")
- Withdraw affection or connection

**DO:**
- Get curious: "Oh, you don't want to. What's going on?"
- Offer information: "If we don't leave now, we'll be late. I don't want to feel rushed."
- Problem-solve: "Okay, what would work for you?"
- Accept: "Okay, not right now. I'll ask again in 5 minutes."

Sometimes you'll hear "no" and realize your request was actually a demand in disguise. That's information. Learn from it.

### But What If I Really Need Compliance?

Not everything can be optional. Here's the distinction:

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Safety issue** | This is a boundary, not a request. "I won't let you run into the street." (Step 10) |
| **Non-negotiable routine** | Give limited choice: "It's bath time. Would you like bubbles or no bubbles?" |
| **Strongly preferred** | Be honest: "I really want you to. Would you be willing to, even though you don't want to?" |
| **Actually flexible** | Make it a true request. Accept "no." |

The key is **honesty**. If it's not actually flexible, don't pretend it is. But examine how many of your "non-negotiables" are actually preferences.

### End-of-Day Reflection (Optional)

At night, briefly review:
- Did I make a true request today?
- What happened when I did?
- Did any of my "requests" turn out to be demands in disguise?

---

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: Request Board

**Time:** 15-20 minutes once this step  
**Goal:** Create a visual reminder of request language

### The Project

Create a simple visual that reminds everyone (including you) what requests sound like.

**Option A: "How We Ask" Poster**

Draw or print a simple poster:

```
HOW WE ASK IN THIS FAMILY

"Would you be willing to...?"
"Can you...?"
"I'd like you to... Would you do that?"
"Would you help me with...?"

IT'S OKAY TO SAY NO (and then we'll figure it out together)
```

Post it where you'll see it during high-friction moments (kitchen, hallway, playroom).

**Option B: Request Jar**

Write common requests on slips of paper:
- "Would you be willing to put your shoes on?"
- "Can you help me carry this?"
- "Would you pick up these toys?"

When you need to ask for something, pull a slip for the language pattern.

**Option C: Simple Sticky Notes**

Put sticky notes in friction spots with just:
- "Would you be willing...?"
- "It's okay to say no"

### For Your 6-Year-Old

Involve her in creating the visual:
- "We're making a poster about asking nicely. What are some good ways to ask?"
- Let her decorate it
- She can add requests she wants to practice with the twins

### Why This Helps

Visual cues interrupt automatic patterns. When you see "Would you be willing...?" you're more likely to use request language instead of defaulting to demands.

---

## Sibling Twist

This step dramatically changes sibling dynamics because demands escalate conflict.

### Your 6-Year-Old's Demands on the Twins

She will naturally command them:
- "Give me that!"
- "Stop it!"
- "Go away!"

Coach request language:
- "Can you try asking [twin] instead of telling?"
- "She might say yes if you ask nicely."
- "Try: 'Would you give me a turn?'"

**Don't expect perfection.** She's 6. Model it, remind her, celebrate when she tries.

### The Twins' Demands on Each Other

At 2, they can't make formal requests yet. But they're learning from watching you.

**What you can do:**
- Model request language when you want something from them
- Narrate their attempts: "[Twin A] wants the truck. [Twin A], can you try 'please'?"
- Celebrate any approximation of asking vs. grabbing

### When Siblings Say No to Each Other

This is a learning opportunity:

1. **Don't force sharing** (revisit Step 11 on protected space)
2. **Coach problem-solving:** "She said no. What else could you do?"
3. **Model acceptance:** "Sometimes people say no. That's allowed."

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> You can **tell the difference** between your requests and your demands. You catch yourself **before** making a demand at least half the time, and you make **more requests than demands** on most days.

Not perfect. Not every time. Just... you're aware of the pattern, and you're shifting.

Secondary indicators:
- You notice when your "request" was actually a demand (because you reacted badly to "no")
- Your 6-year-old starts using request language sometimes
- Daily friction feels slightly lower

If this still feels foreign after two weeks, stay on Step 15. This is a deep rewiring.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "If everything is a request, nothing will get done"

Not everything needs to be a request. Boundaries and safety rules are not requests (Step 10). Routines can have limited choice ("bath time is now — bubbles or no bubbles?").

The goal isn't to eliminate all expectations. It's to stop using threats and commands for things that could be requests.

Examine your "must-haves." How many are actually preferences?

### "I keep making demands in disguise"

This is normal. You'll catch yourself reacting badly to "no" and realize: "Oh, that wasn't actually a request."

**The learning is in the noticing.** Over time, you'll catch yourself earlier — before you speak, not after.

Keep practicing. This takes months, not days.

### "My 2-year-olds don't respond to requests"

At 2, they're not reliably responding to ANYTHING. This is normal.

Your job isn't to get compliance. Your job is to model request language so they absorb the pattern. You're planting seeds.

Use requests AND limited choice: "Would you like to put on the red shoes or the blue shoes?"

### "My 6-year-old says no to everything now"

If she starts saying no more, that might mean:
1. She finally feels safe to say no (good sign)
2. She's testing boundaries (normal)
3. She heard "you can say no" and is experimenting

Respond with:
- Curiosity: "You're saying no a lot lately. What's going on?"
- Problem-solving: "Okay, no to that. What would work for you?"
- Limit when needed: "I hear you don't want to. This one isn't optional, but I want to understand what's hard about it."

### "This feels manipulative — like I'm tricking them"

The difference between manipulation and NVC is **intention**.

**Manipulation:** Using request language to get compliance, but still punishing refusal
**True request:** Genuinely prioritizing connection over compliance

Check your intention. Are you okay if they say no? If not, either make it a boundary (Step 10) or examine why compliance matters so much.

### "My partner/co-parent still makes demands"

You can only control yourself. Model request language consistently. 

If they're curious: share what you're learning.
If they're not: keep practicing anyway. Your children will learn from both of you, and your modeling still matters.

### "PDA kid — everything triggers resistance" (ND Adaptation)

For PDA, the demand-avoidance is neurological, not behavioral. Requests help, but you may need more:

- Offer "no" explicitly: "You can say no. I just want to know what you need."
- Indirect requests: "I wonder if anyone wants to help me carry groceries..." (not directed at them)
- Wait longer for processing
- Accept delayed compliance (they do it 10 minutes later, on their terms)
- Reduce the total number of asks per day
