title: "Description & Information"
step: 7
phase: 3
phaseName: "Cooperation Without Coercion"
---

**Phase:** 3 — Cooperation Without Coercion  
**Duration:** 1 week minimum (repeat if needed)

---

## The One Thing

> **This step, you describe what you see and give information — instead of commanding.**

Now that you've built connection during big feelings (Phase 2), we're ready to work on cooperation without coercion (Phase 3).

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. Instead of "Put on your shoes!" try "I see bare feet. We leave in 5 minutes."

If your brain is fried, this is not a "do it perfectly" week. One experiment per day (or less) is enough. Commands are still allowed; we're just gently shifting the ratio over time.

> **Remember the order:**
> 1. Check brain states — flooded or receptive? (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first, name & validate feelings (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: this step's tool

---

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Replace commands with description/information | Throughout day |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Count commands for one day, replace one | 1 day tracking |
| **3. Environment** | Create one visual support | 20-30 min once |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Catch yourself commanding and rephrase once
- **1-2 minutes:** Count how many commands you gave this morning
- **20-30 minutes once this step:** Make one visual support

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** (Track 1 is the core skill) and call it a win.

**Minimum week:** Pick **one** situation (e.g., shoes in the morning) and only practice description/information there. Ignore everything else if you need to.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 7 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

In Steps 5-6, you focused on naming feelings and co-regulating during big emotions. This week, we use that connection to shift how you invite cooperation.

### The Science (30-second version)

Commands trigger resistance. It's human nature — nobody likes being bossed around.

When you describe what you see or give information, you:
- Invite the child to think for themselves
- Reduce power struggles
- Preserve their sense of autonomy
- Keep the relationship collaborative, not adversarial

**"Put on your shoes!" = You're in charge, obey.**  
**"I see bare feet. We leave in 5 minutes." = Here's the situation, you know what to do.**

The second approach treats them as capable. Kids rise to meet that expectation.

### What This Changes

Once you internalize "describe, don't command," you stop:
- Repeating yourself endlessly
- Feeling like a drill sergeant
- Triggering unnecessary power struggles

You start:
- Speaking less (fewer words)
- Inviting cooperation instead of demanding it
- Noticing kids cooperate more naturally

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Description and Information Instead of Commands

### The Formula

1. **Describe what you see** ("I see toys on the floor")
2. **Give information** ("Toys live in the basket")
3. **One word** — after pattern is established ("Toys." / "Shoes." / "Teeth.")
4. **Then wait 10-30 seconds** before saying anything else.

### Transformation Examples

| Instead of... | Try Description | Or Information |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| "Put on your shoes!" | "I see bare feet." | "We leave in 5 minutes." |
| "Clean up your toys!" | "I see blocks everywhere." | "When toys are in the basket, we can find them later." |
| "Brush your teeth!" | "I smell breakfast breath." | "Teeth need brushing before stories." |
| "Come to dinner!" | "I see your plate on the table." | "Dinner is getting cold." |
| "Stop running inside!" | "I see running feet." | "Inside is for walking. Outside is for running." |
| "Be quiet!" | "I hear loud voices." | "The baby is sleeping." |
| "Get dressed!" | "I see pajamas." | "We put on clothes before breakfast." |

### Age-Specific Scripts

**For 2-Year-Olds (Twins):**

| Situation | Description/Information |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Won't put on shoes | "I see bare feet! Shoes go on feet." (Touch feet, point to shoes) |
| Throwing food | "I see food on the floor. Food stays on the plate." |
| Won't come for diaper | "I see a wet diaper! Dry diaper coming." (Keep it light, playful) |
| Hitting sibling | "I see hands hitting. Hands are for gentle." (Physically guide if needed) |

**Keep it VERY simple.** Short sentences. May need physical guidance too — they're still learning words.

**For 6-Year-Old:**

| Situation | Description/Information |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Hasn't started homework | "I see an empty worksheet. Homework is done before screen time." |
| Clothes on floor | "I see your clothes didn't make it to the hamper." |
| Dawdling in morning | "I notice you're not dressed yet. We leave at 7:30." |
| Didn't clear plate | "Your plate is still on the table." (Wait. Let them figure it out.) |

**The one-word version** (after they know the expectation):
- "Shoes."
- "Teeth."
- "Plate."
- "Homework."

Less words = less nagging, less resistance.

For very literal or anxious kids, keep your tone **neutral and matter-of-fact**, not sarcastic. Same words, different tone = very different impact for ND brains.

### The Wait

After describing or giving information: **WAIT.**

Don't immediately follow up with more words. Give them 10-30 seconds to process and respond. This is especially important for ND kids.

The wait shows you trust them to figure it out.

If it helps, silently count to 10 or take 3 slow breaths so you don't fill the silence.

### ND Adaptation

**Processing time:**
- Give 10-30 seconds (really) before repeating or adding words
- ND kids often process language more slowly, especially when attention is elsewhere
- If they don't respond, try moving closer or getting on their level before repeating

**Visual supports may help more than words:**
- Point to the shoes while saying "Feet!"
- Use picture schedules for routines
- Some kids need to SEE it, not just hear it — visuals reduce language and working-memory load, which is especially helpful for autistic/ADHD kids

**If auditory processing is an issue:**
- Fewer words are better (one word is ideal)
- Get their attention first (say name, gentle touch)
- Avoid giving important information from another room or while they're focused on a screen; their brain may literally not register it

**If the words feel controlling to them anyway:**
- Try questions: "What goes on feet before we leave?"
- Try observations: "Hmm, I'm noticing something missing..." (playful tone)
- For kids who push back on anything that *sounds* like control, keep your voice light and curious. The **tone** matters as much as the words.

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Command Audit

**Time:** 1 day of tracking, then ongoing awareness  
**Goal:** Notice your command patterns and replace one per day

### The Practice

**Day 1: Count**
- Carry a small notepad or use your phone
- Every time you give a command ("Do X", "Stop Y", "Don't Z"), make a tick mark
- No judgment — just data

**Day 2 onward: Replace one**
- Just ONE command per day, catch yourself and rephrase
- Use description or information instead
- Notice what happens

### What You'll Probably Discover

Most parents are shocked at how many commands they give. 50+ per day is not unusual with young kids.

Common patterns:
- Mornings and transitions have the most commands
- Certain situations trigger command-mode
- Some kids get more commands than others

### Why This Matters

- Awareness is the first step
- You can't change what you don't notice
- One replacement per day = 7 per week = shift in habit over time

### ND Adaptation

If tracking feels overwhelming:
- Track just one hour (the morning routine, for example)
- Or skip tracking and just focus on catching yourself once per day

If this feels like too much, skip the counting and just move to "catch one command and rephrase it" on any day you choose.

Executive function is limited, especially if you're ND and tired. It's okay if some days you have **zero** capacity for this.

If you notice yourself going into command-mode when stressed:
- That's normal — commands are faster
- When flooded, don't worry about rephrasing
- When okay-enough, practice the skill

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: One Visual Support

**Time:** 20-30 minutes once this week  
**Goal:** Create one visual support for a recurring issue

### What's a Visual Support?

A visual cue that shows expectations without you having to say words.

### Ideas

Pick **ONE** recurring issue only. Ignore the rest for now.

| Recurring Issue | Visual Support |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Morning routine chaos | Picture schedule on fridge (wake → potty → clothes → breakfast → teeth → shoes) |
| Coat/shoes everywhere | Photo of where they go, taped at kid-eye level |
| Forgetting lunch prep | Checklist with pictures by the door |
| Bedtime battles | Visual bedtime routine poster |
| "What can I eat?" | Photo list of approved snacks on pantry door |

### ND Adaptation

Visuals are especially powerful for ND kids and ND parents: they cut down on talking, memory load, and repeated nagging. Avoid cluttered posters or too many colors; simple, calm visuals are easier for ND brains to use.

### How to Make It

**Simple option:**
- Draw stick figures or use photos from magazines
- Print from the internet
- Write words (for the 6-year-old who's reading)

**Slightly fancier:**
- Take photos of YOUR child doing each step
- Laminate for durability
- Use velcro to check off steps

**Minimum viable version:**
- Sticky note with words or simple drawings
- Taped where they need it

### Where to Put It

- **Eye level** for the child (not adult eye level)
- **Where the routine happens** (bathroom for teeth-brushing, front door for leaving)
- **Easy to see** without searching

### Introducing It

When everyone's calm:
1. Show them the visual
2. Walk through it together
3. "This is our new helper for morning time"
4. Practice using it when there's no pressure

### Age Adaptations

**For 2-Year-Olds (Twins):**
- Very simple visuals (1-3 images maximum)
- Photos work better than drawings
- They can't use this independently yet — you point and guide
- "First: clothes. See? Then: shoes. See?"

**For 6-Year-Old:**
- Can read simple words
- Can help create the visual (drawings, choosing photos)
- Can use it semi-independently ("Check your chart!")
- Ownership increases buy-in

### Twin Dynamics

- Make identical visuals for each twin OR one shared visual they follow together
- If they're competitive: "Who can do the next step?" (use carefully — competition can backfire)
- Individual check-off boxes can help ("I did it!")

## Sibling Twist

When kids are in conflict, try describing instead of commanding:

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Stop fighting!" | "I see two kids who both want the same toy." |
| "Share!" | "There's one toy and two kids who want it." |
| "Say sorry!" | "He's crying. His arm got hurt." |
| "Be nice to your brother!" | "I see someone feeling left out." |

Then wait. Often they'll start problem-solving once the situation is named neutrally.

**Follow-up (if needed):**
- "What can we do about this?"
- "How could we make this work for both of you?"

If they freeze or seem stuck, you can gently scaffold: "Do we need a timer? A turn-taking plan? Or two toys?"

If anyone is in meltdown, use your Step 5-6 skills first (name feelings, co-regulate), then shift into describing.

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> You catch yourself before commanding and rephrase — at least once a day.

Not every time. Not even half. Just... the awareness is there. You pause, think "command or describe?" and sometimes choose describe.

If that's not happening after a week, stay on Step 7. This is a deep habit change.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "They ignore description/information and I end up commanding anyway"

A few things might be happening:

- **Not enough wait time:** Give them 10-30 seconds after you speak
- **Too far away:** Get close before speaking
- **Attention not on you:** Say their name first, or gentle touch
- **Expectation not established:** They may not know what "toys in basket" means if they've never done it

Sometimes you DO have to command (safety, urgency). That's fine. The goal is reduction, not elimination.

### "This feels too slow for my morning"

Start practicing in lower-stakes moments (afternoon, weekends). Once it's more automatic, it'll work in mornings.

In true time-crunch: do what you need to do. Practice when there's margin.

In true time-crunch or meltdown moments: do what you need to survive. This skill is for **practice windows**, not emergencies.

### "Sensory overload is happening"

If they're dysregulated (too loud, too bright, too tired), their brain may not be available for any kind of language. Focus on calming the environment first.

### "My 2-year-olds don't understand information yet"

They're learning. Pair words with physical guidance:
- "Shoes go on feet" (while putting shoes on)
- "Food stays on plate" (while gently guiding hand back)

It's planting seeds. Understanding comes with repetition.

### "My 6-year-old just argues with the information"

If they say "I KNOW we leave in 5 minutes!":
- "Yep. And I notice feet are still bare." (Neutral, not sarcastic)
- Then wait. Don't engage the argument.

The point isn't to be right — it's to give information and let them choose.

Many ND kids use arguing as a way to process or to feel some control. You can acknowledge their knowledge without dropping the information.

## Quick Reference Card

*(Print this page only if overwhelmed)*

### This Step's Skill

**Describe and inform instead of commanding**

### The Formula

1. Describe what you see ("I see bare feet")
2. Give information ("We leave in 5 minutes")
3. One word — when established ("Shoes.")

### Transformations

| Command | Description/Info |
|---------|------------------|
| Put on shoes! | I see bare feet. We leave in 5 min. |
| Clean up! | Toys live in the basket. |
| Be quiet! | The baby is sleeping. |

### Key Principles

- **Say less, wait more**
- Give 10-30 seconds processing time
- Get close before speaking
- One word is ideal (once established)

### Visual Support

Create ONE visual for a recurring issue. Post at kid-eye level where the action happens.
