**Phase:** 4 — Boundaries, Siblings, Problem-Solving  
**Duration:** 1 week minimum (repeat if needed)

---

## The One Thing

> **This step, you teach kids that problems have solutions and relationships survive mistakes.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. Just do ONE repair this week — say "I'm sorry, I messed up" to a child after you lose your cool — and if that's all you do with this whole course, that's still meaningful.

> **Remember the order:**
> 1. Check brain states — flooded or receptive? (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first, name & validate feelings (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: this step's tool

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Problem-solving (6-year-old) + practice runs (twins) | 5-10 min conversations |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Do one deliberate repair | One moment this week |
| **3. Environment** | Start simple weekly family check-in | 10-15 min once/week |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** After you mess up, say: "I'm sorry. That wasn't okay."
- **5-10 minutes:** Try one problem-solving conversation with your 6-year-old
- **10-15 minutes:** Do one family check-in at the end of the week

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** — Track 2 (the repair) is often the most transformative, but any track you do is worth celebrating.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 12 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

Two things predict resilient, well-adjusted kids:

1. **They believe they can affect outcomes.** This comes from having their ideas heard and seeing solutions work.

2. **They've experienced relationship repair.** Ruptures (fights, yelling, disappointment) are inevitable. What matters is what happens AFTER.

Kids who experience consistent repair learn:
- Mistakes are survivable
- Relationships can handle conflict
- Apologizing is strength, not weakness

Kids who DON'T experience repair learn:
- Mistakes are catastrophic
- Conflict means rejection
- Never admit fault

If you've rarely or never done repair before, you haven't "ruined" anything. Kids are remarkably responsive to even small, new experiences of repair — it's never too late to start.

### What This Changes

Once you practice problem-solving and repair:
- Your 6-year-old develops an internal "I can figure this out" muscle
- Your twins learn conflict scripts before they need them
- YOU model that messing up doesn't mean failure
- Everyone in the family knows: "We fix things here."

---

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Problem-Solving (6-Year-Old) + Practice Runs (Twins)

Step 11 gave you tools for during-conflict safety (the Safety Ladder). This step is about what happens *after* — when everyone is calm, how do you solve the underlying problem and repair the relationship?

### For Your 6-Year-Old: Collaborative Problem-Solving

Pick a SMALL, RECURRING problem to start. Not "you never listen" — something specific like:
- Morning battles about getting dressed
- Fights over screen time ending
- Bedtime delays

#### The Steps

| Step | What to Say | What You're Doing |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1. Pick the moment | Wait until everyone is calm and receptive | Not during the problem |
| 2. Acknowledge feeling | "I've noticed mornings are really hard. You seem frustrated." | Showing you see her side |
| 3. Describe problem | "And I'm frustrated too because we keep being late." | Stating your side without blame |
| 4. Ask for ideas | "What do you think we could do about this?" | Inviting her brain into the solution |
| 5. Brain-dump | Write down ALL ideas — even silly ones ("hire a butler") | Showing all ideas welcome |
| 6. Choose one to try | "Which one should we try tomorrow?" | Giving her ownership |
| 7. Check back | Next day: "How did that work? Do we need to adjust?" | Following through |

If your brain goes blank, that's normal. You can come with 2-3 starter ideas written down and say, "Here are some ideas I had; want to add any or pick one?"

If the first idea flops, that's not failure — that's data. "Okay, that didn't work. Let's try a different one next time."

If your child or you don't like sitting and talking:
- Try problem-solving while walking, drawing together, or playing with LEGO
- Let them draw their ideas instead of saying them

#### Example Scripts for 6-Year-Old

**Morning problem:**
> "Hey, can we talk about mornings? I've noticed you seem really frustrated when I tell you to get dressed, and I feel frustrated when we're rushing. I don't want us to start every day upset. What do you think we could try?"

**Screen time problem:**
> "Ending screen time has been really hard lately. You get upset, I get upset. I wonder if we can figure out something that works better. What ideas do you have?"

**Sibling problem:**
> "You've been really frustrated with the twins lately. That makes sense — they're a lot. What do you think might help you get some space from them?"

### For Your 2-Year-Old Twins: Practice Runs and Micro-Choices

They're too young for collaborative problem-solving. Instead, build skills through:

#### Micro-Choices (Whenever Possible)

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "Put on your shoes" | "Red shoes or blue shoes?" |
| "Time to eat" | "Spoon or fork?" |
| "We're leaving" | "Walk to the car or hop like a bunny?" |

#### Practice Runs (Before the Hard Moment)

Before conflict happens, rehearse:

| Skill | Practice Run |
|-------|--------------|
| Taking turns | "Let's practice! I have the ball. Now I say 'your turn' and give it to you. Now you say 'my turn' and give it back." |
| Using words | "When you want something, say 'mine' or 'my turn.' Let's practice. Say 'my turn!'" |
| Transitions | "In 5 minutes we're going to the car. Let's practice! When I turn off the music, we walk to the car. Ready? [Turn off music] Yay! You walked to the car!" |

#### Age-Specific Expectations

| 6-Year-Old | 2-Year-Old Twins |
|-----|-----------|
| Can engage in back-and-forth problem-solving | Can't yet — too abstract |
| May need help generating ideas at first | Respond to choices and practice |
| Can remember solutions for next time | Need many, many repetitions |
| Will test if you follow through | Won't understand why rules exist |

---

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: One Deliberate Repair

**Time:** One moment this step  
**Goal:** Model that mistakes are survivable and relationships can heal

### What Is Repair?

Repair is what happens AFTER you mess up. You will mess up. Everyone does.

Repair teaches your kids:
- Adults make mistakes too
- Apologizing is brave, not weak
- Love survives conflict
- They're not responsible for your emotions

Repair doesn't mean your feelings or needs don't matter. It just separates your behavior ("I yelled") from your worth (you're still a good parent) and theirs (they're still a good kid).

### The Repair Script

When you've yelled, lost your cool, been unfair, or hurt their feelings:

| Step | What to Say | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1. Own it | "I yelled at you. That wasn't okay." | No excuses, no "but" |
| 2. Name your feeling | "I was really overwhelmed." | Helps them understand, models naming emotions |
| 3. State love + plan | "You're a good kid having a hard time. I'm working on shouting less." | Reassures them and shows you're trying |

You don't have to hit all three parts perfectly. Even a short, imperfect, slightly awkward repair is many times better than none.

### What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "I'm sorry, BUT if you hadn't..." | This is a blame, not an apology |
| "You made me yell" | They're not responsible for your emotions |
| Excessive guilt/self-flagellation | Makes it about you, not them |
| Demand they accept the apology | Repair is given, not extracted |
| Promise you'll never do it again | You might. Honesty matters. |
| "See? I apologized, now you have to be fine" | Makes repair a control move instead of connection |

### Age-Specific Repair

**For 6-year-old:**
> "Hey, can I talk to you for a second? I yelled at you earlier about the toys. That wasn't okay. I was really tired and overwhelmed, but that's not an excuse. You're a good kid, and you didn't deserve to be yelled at. I'm working on staying calmer. I love you."

**For 2-year-old twins:**
> Keep it simpler. Crouch down, gentle voice: "Mama got too loud. I'm sorry. I love you." Offer a hug if they want one.

### ND Adaptation

If verbal apologies feel performative or script-y:
- Physical repair counts: A long hug, extra snuggle time, their favorite activity together
- Written repair: A little note for your 6-year-old
- The key is RECONNECTION, not specific words

If you're prone to excessive guilt:
- One repair, done simply, is enough
- You don't need to grovel or over-explain
- Model healthy, boundaried apology

**If naming your feelings is hard (alexithymia is common in ND parents):**
- Use simple, broad words: "My brain was overloaded," "My body felt too buzzy," or "I was too full"
- It's okay to skip naming the feeling sometimes and just say, "I got too loud. I'm sorry. I'm working on it."

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: Weekly Family Check-In

**Time:** 10-15 minutes once this week (then weekly if it works)  
**Goal:** Create a ritual where problems get named and solved together

### The Setup

Pick a time that works weekly:
- Sunday evening
- Friday dinner
- Saturday morning pancakes

Keep it SHORT. 10-15 minutes max. If it becomes a slog, kids will dread it.

### The Check-In Structure

Three questions, go around the table:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "What went well this week?" | Builds positive focus, everyone shares a win |
| "What was hard this week?" | Names problems without shame |
| "One thing we want to do differently?" | Action-oriented, forward-looking |

If open questions are hard (for you or your 6-year-old), offer a menu:
- "What went well: time with grandma / screen time / playing outside?"
- "What was hard: mornings / bedtime / sharing toys?"

If you or your kids are sensory-sensitive:
- Keep lights gentle, no background TV
- Allow fidgets, drawing, or movement during check-in

Try an asynchronous check-in: everyone draws or writes their "good / hard / different next time" on sticky notes and you read them together, or even just you read them.

### Age Adaptations

| 6-Year-Old | 2-Year-Old Twins |
|-----|-----------|
| Can answer all three questions | Can answer "what was fun?" |
| May have sibling complaints — validate without fixing | May point to something, say one word |
| Can suggest solutions | Participate by sitting at table, being included |

### Sample First Check-In

> "We're going to try something new. Every [Sunday], we're going to sit together for 10 minutes and talk about our week. Everyone gets a turn. No one gets in trouble for what they say. Here are the questions..."

### Let Kids Suggest Rules

If the 6-year-old has been frustrated with sibling dynamics, this is where to channel it:

> "What's one rule you think would help everyone get along better?"

Write it down. Try it for a week. Check back.

### If It Flops

Some families love check-ins. Some don't. If yours resists:
- Make it shorter (5 minutes)
- Combine it with something fun (dessert, game time after)
- Try 1:1 check-ins instead of whole family
- Drop it and try again in a few months

---

## Sibling Twist

After you've used the Safety Ladder (Step 11) and everyone is calm, this is how you guide repair.

**Repair applies to sibling relationships too.**

When one child hurts another (accidentally or on purpose), guide repair:

For the child who hurt:
- "Your sister is crying. What could help her feel better?"
- Not forced "say sorry" — but coached toward connection
- If they're still flooded, wait. Repair comes after calm.

For the hurt child:
- "That hurt. Your brother is going to check on you."
- They don't have to accept the apology
- "It's okay if you're still upset."

We're helping them notice impact and offer care, not teaching them they're responsible for someone else's feelings forever.

### Age-Specific Sibling Repair

| 6-year-old hurts twin | Twin hurts 6-year-old | Twin hurts twin |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "[Twin] is upset. I know you didn't mean to hurt her that badly. What could help?" | 6-year-old: validate. "That hurt. Your brother is 2 and still learning." To twin: "We don't hit. Hitting hurts." (Simple, no long explanation) | Comfort hurt twin. To hitting twin: "Ouch, that hurt brother. Gentle hands." (Then redirect — they don't have the brain for repair yet.) |

For the twins, comfort and simple limits ("Gentle hands") are enough; expecting a true repair from a 2-year-old will only frustrate everyone.

## Mastery Indicator

**This is Step 12 of 12 — the end of the core curriculum.** If you've gotten this far in any form (even skimming), that's a huge win.

It's normal to loop back to earlier weeks or stay here longer. Skills grow in loops, not straight lines.

**You've got this when:**

> You can do a **repair after rupture** — apologize simply, without excessive guilt, without "but you...", and then move on.

Not perfectly. Not every time. Just... when you mess up, you know how to come back. And your kids are starting to see that mistakes are survivable.

Mastery here does *not* mean you always repair or always stay calm. It means repair is available to you as a tool, even if you sometimes forget or are too overwhelmed.

70% is good enough. If you're doing this some of the time and more than you used to, that's success.

If repair still feels impossible or shame-spiraling, stay on Step 12. This is the hardest skill in the curriculum for many parents.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I apologize but then I feel guilty for hours"

The repair is about THEM, not about you processing your guilt.

Keep it brief:
1. Own it
2. Name feeling
3. State love + plan
4. Move on

If guilt lingers, that's for your own processing (journal, therapy, self-compassion practice) — not something to work out with your child.

*If* you still feel awful, that doesn't mean the repair "didn't count." The repair can land for your child even while your brain is screaming at you. Trust the action, not the shame thoughts.

### "My 6-year-old doesn't want to problem-solve"

Possible reasons:
- She's flooded (wait until calm)
- She doesn't believe you'll listen (build trust over time)
- She doesn't have ideas (that's okay — offer some)
- She doesn't like talking (try while doing an activity, walking, or drawing)
- She feels "problem-solving" is a demand (especially PDA kids). Try framing it as "experimenting" or "designing a new morning routine" instead of "solving a problem."

Don't force it. Try once, drop it, try again another day.

### "The twins don't understand practice runs"

They won't at first. Keep them SHORT (30 seconds) and make them silly/fun.

The practice run is planting seeds. Don't expect them to remember in the moment for months. Keep practicing.

### "Family check-in feels forced/awkward"

It often does at first. Common fixes:
- Keep it shorter
- Do it during an existing routine (meal, car ride)
- You go first to model
- Use objects: "Put a pom-pom in the happy jar for something good, problem jar for something hard"

### Partner Angle: Repair Between Parents

The same repair template works with your partner — especially when kids witnessed the conflict.

| Kid Repair | Partner Repair |
|------------|----------------|
| "I yelled. That wasn't okay." | "Earlier when I said 'you never help,' I was overwhelmed." |
| "I was really tired." | "I'm sorry I said it that way." |
| "I'm working on staying calmer." | "I wish I'd said 'I'm at my limit — can you take over?'" |

If kids saw you arguing:
> "You heard us disagreeing earlier. We were both stressed. We've talked and we're okay now."

See the **[Co-Parenting Guide](/parenting/companions/co-parenting-guide/)** for more on partner repair.

## Quick Reference Card

*(Print this page only if overwhelmed)*

### Problem-Solving (6-Year-Old)

1. Wait until calm
2. "I've noticed [problem]. You seem [feeling]. I feel [feeling]."
3. "What could we try?"
4. Brain-dump ideas
5. Pick one to try
6. Check back

### Practice Runs (2-Year-Olds)

- "Let's practice saying 'my turn'!"
- "When the music stops, we walk to the car. Let's try!"
- Keep it 30 seconds, make it fun

### Repair After Rupture

1. **Own it:** "I yelled. That wasn't okay."
2. **Name feeling:** "I was really overwhelmed."
3. **Love + plan:** "You're a good kid. I'm working on it."

❌ No "but if you hadn't..."  
❌ No excessive guilt  
❌ No demanding they accept

### Weekly Check-In

10-15 min, 3 questions:
- What went well?
- What was hard?
- One thing to do differently?

---

## What Now? (After Step 12)

You've completed the core curriculum. That doesn't mean you're "done" — it means you have a full toolkit.

**If life is on fire:**
Use [Emergency Mode](/parenting/companions/emergency-mode-guide/) or the [6-Step Compact Path](/parenting/companions/compact-path/).

**If core 1–12 mostly feel solid (~70%):**
Consider [Steps 13–16](/parenting/) (extensions for deeper work).

**If core still feels shaky:**
Loop back to Steps 1–6 and live there. There's no deadline.

---

### Other Options

**Loop back faster:** Start at Step 1 and move faster (3-4 days per step instead of a full week). Notice what's easier now.

**One skill per month:** Pick the step that feels most alive (maybe Step 4's special time or Step 10's boundaries) and stay there for a whole month.

There's no graduation. This is a toolkit you circle through as your kids (and you) grow.
