**Duration:** 1 week minimum (repeat if needed)

## The One Thing

> **This step, you stay with them during hard feelings. You co-regulate. Time-in, not time-out.**

Being present can mean **sitting nearby** or **waiting just outside the door** if they need space — the key is: you're available and not sending them away as a punishment.

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. When they're melting down, just be present. "I'm right here with you."

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Emotion coaching sequence + calm-down strategies | During meltdowns |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Yell-Less Plan | 10 min setup, ongoing |
| **3. Environment** | Create calm-down corner or kit | 30 min setup |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Stay present during one meltdown instead of walking away
- **1-2 minutes:** Choose your Yell-Less mantra
- **30 minutes once this step:** Set up a simple calm-down corner

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** (Track 1 is the core skill) and call it a win.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 6 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

Children don't learn to regulate alone — they learn through **co-regulation** with a calm adult.

**Quick definitions:**
- **Co-regulation:** Your relatively calm body and presence help their nervous system calm down. You're with them in the storm.
- **Self-regulation:** They use skills to calm down more on their own (sometimes with you nearby but not involved).

Young kids and kids who are very upset usually need **co-regulation first**. Over time, they learn self-regulation from what you model.

When you stay present during their distress:

- Your calm nervous system helps calm theirs
- They learn "big feelings don't destroy connection"
- Over time, they internalize the strategies you model
- The relationship gets stronger, not weaker

**Time-out sends the message: "Your feelings are too much for me."**  
**Time-in sends the message: "I can handle you at your worst."**

### What This Changes

Once you internalize "co-regulate first, teach later," you stop:
- Sending kids away when they need you most
- Feeling like you need to "do something" to fix the meltdown
- Treating big emotions as problems to eliminate

You start:
- Being a calm presence (even if internal chaos)
- Offering strategies instead of demands
- Seeing meltdowns as connection opportunities

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Emotion Coaching Sequence

### The Full Sequence

1. **Name the feeling** (Step 5 skill)
2. **Validate** ("Of course you're upset")
3. **Set a limit if needed** ("And hitting isn't okay")
4. **Offer a strategy** ("Would you like to squeeze my hands?")

You're connecting AND teaching, in that order. You're basically taking your Step 5 skill (name + validate) and adding a gentle limit and one strategy.

**On survival mode days (ND-friendly version):**
- Just do **Step 1 + Step 2**: name the feeling and validate it
- You can skip limits and strategies in the moment if that's too much

That *still* counts as emotion coaching.

### Age-Specific Calm-Down Strategies

**For 2-Year-Olds (Twins):**

| Strategy | How It Looks |
|----------|--------------|
| **Hug/squeeze** | "Want a squeeze?" — hold them tight |
| **Rock together** | Sit with them on your lap, rock slowly |
| **Sing** | Simple, repetitive song in calm voice |
| **Lovey/comfort object** | "Here's your bunny" |
| **Movement** | Pick up and sway, walk together, bounce |
| **Sensory** | Soft blanket, textured toy, cold water on hands |

**For 6-Year-Old:**

| Strategy | How It Looks |
|----------|--------------|
| **Breathing together** | "Let's take three breaths. In... out..." (you lead) |
| **Calm-down corner** | "Want to go to your calm-down corner?" |
| **Squeeze/push** | "Push against my hands really hard" (wall push also works) |
| **Draw the feeling** | "Want to draw how mad you are?" |
| **Stomp it out** | "Let's stomp our feet really hard" |
| **Count together** | Slow counting to 10, or backwards from 5 |

### The Co-Regulation Script (Time-In)

When they're melting down:

> "You're having such a hard time. I'm going to sit with you."

Then:
- Sit nearby (not in their face)
- Speak slowly and quietly
- Wait. Don't rush them through it.
- Stay regulated yourself (this is the hard part)

### If They Need Space

Some kids (especially ND kids) regulate better alone. Watch for signs:
- They push you away
- They say "Go away!" or "Leave me alone!"
- Your presence seems to escalate them

**Space script:**
> "I'm going to be right outside the door. You're safe. I'll come back in a minute."

Then actually check back. The message is "space is okay, I'm not abandoning you."

This is them practicing **self-regulation with backup** — you're nearby and available, but giving their nervous system the kind of space it prefers.

> **Buddhist Lens (Optional):** Co-regulation is *being with* suffering, not fixing it. Brave Parenting uses the river metaphor: when we dam emotions by fixing, shushing, or distracting, they back up. When we let the river run — staying present while the storm passes — emotions move through naturally. This isn't passive; it's the hardest kind of bravery. See [Buddhist Lens](/parenting/companions/buddhist-lens/) for more.
>
> ND twist: Some kids co-regulate better with more space and fewer words; "being with the river" can mean sitting outside the door, not right next to them.

### When to Set a Limit

Limits come AFTER naming and validating, not before:

- "You're so frustrated (name). Of course — you wanted that (validate). AND hitting hurts (limit). You can hit this pillow instead (redirect)."

Keep limits short and calm. This isn't a lecture moment.

### ND Adaptation

**If your child regulates better with space:**
- This is **self-regulation**, not rejection
- Don't force closeness — it can dysregulate further
- Stay nearby but not touching/staring
- Offer: "Want me here or do you need space?"

**Proprioceptive input often works better than grounding:**
- Heavy pushing against wall/hands
- Tight squeezes (if they like pressure)
- Jumping, stomping, carrying something heavy
- Chewing on something chewy

**Eye contact may dysregulate:**
- Sit side by side, not face to face
- Look at something together instead of at each other
- Don't require eye contact to show they're "listening"

**If they can't hear words when flooded:**
- Use fewer words, simpler words
- Hum or sing instead
- Just be present — your calm body communicates

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Yell-Less Plan

**Time:** 10 minutes to set up, then ongoing  
**Goal:** Help *you* self-regulate so you can co-regulate them, and reduce yelling by having a plan BEFORE you're triggered.

This is your **self-regulation plan** — what *you* do with your nervous system so you can show up as "okay-enough" while they fall apart.

### The Three Parts

1. **Choose your mantra** (what you'll say silently to yourself)
2. **Put reminders in trigger locations** (visual cues)
3. **Have an escape route** (what you do instead of yelling)

### Step 1: Choose Your Mantra

Pick one that resonates (or write your own):

- "This is not an emergency."
- "They're not giving me a hard time, they're having a hard time."
- "I can handle this."
- "What do they need right now?"
- "Is this the parent I want to be?"
- "Pause."

### Step 2: Put Reminders in Trigger Locations

Where do you yell most? Put a visual cue there:
- Sticky note on kitchen cabinet
- Small stone in your pocket
- Phone wallpaper
- Word written on your wrist

The cue just says: **PAUSE** or your mantra

### Step 3: Have an Escape Route

When you feel the yell rising:

1. **Walk to another room** (if kids are safe) — even 30 seconds helps
2. **Go to the sink and splash cold water on your face** (resets nervous system)
3. **Put your hands on the counter and take 5 breaths**
4. **Step outside for 60 seconds** (tell kids: "I need to calm my brain. I'll be right back.")

**If you can't leave (twins climbing, safety worries):**
- Turn your body slightly away, drop your shoulders, and exhale slowly 3 times
- Put one hand on your chest or the counter and feel your feet on the floor
- Say your mantra silently once

Even a **5-second** micro-pause is self-regulation.

### ND Adaptation

**If you go from 0 to yelling with no warning:**
- Your cues need to be body-based (phone vibration reminder, texture in pocket)
- Focus on escape route more than prevention
- Forgive fast and repair after

**If shutdown/freeze is your pattern:**
- Your "escape" might be: close eyes, ground feet, wait for brain to come back
- A quick cold water splash can help reset freeze

**If verbal mantras feel fake:**
- Use a physical cue: squeeze your own hand, press feet into floor
- Or just one word: "Pause" / "Wait" / "Breathe"

**If noise is your main trigger (common for ND parents):**
- It's okay to use **earplugs** or noise-reducing headphones during meltdowns if it keeps you out of rage-zone
- Lowering sound input *is* a valid self-regulation strategy

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: Calm-Down Corner or Kit

**Time:** 30 minutes to set up  
**Goal:** Create a designated space or kit for calming down

### Option A: Calm-Down Corner

Find a small space that can be "the calm-down corner":
- Corner of bedroom with cushions
- Small tent or canopy
- Closet with door removed or left open
- Space behind a couch

Stock it with:
- Soft things (blanket, stuffed animal)
- Fidgets (stress ball, textured toys)
- Headphones (noise reduction or music)
- A few calming books
- Maybe: glitter jar, breathing cards, photos of loved ones

### Option B: Calm-Down Kit (Portable)

A box or bag that can go anywhere:
- Small blanket
- Comfort item
- 2-3 fidgets
- Headphones
- Simple calming visuals (breathing card)

### CRITICAL: Introduce When Calm

**Don't introduce this space during a meltdown.**

When everyone's calm:
1. Show them the space/kit
2. Let them explore it
3. Practice going there together when calm
4. Say: "This is where we can go when big feelings come"

The space should feel like a refuge, not a punishment.

### Age Adaptations

**For 2-Year-Olds (Twins):**
- They can't use this independently yet
- YOU bring them to the space and stay with them
- Keep it very simple: soft thing, one comfort object
- It's about building the habit of "we go here to calm down together"

**For 6-Year-Old:**
- Can start to use independently (with practice)
- Let them help choose what goes in it
- Can have a "calm-down menu" — simple **pictures** of strategies to try (great for ND kids who access visuals faster than words)
- Check in: "Would you like to go to your calm-down corner, or would you like me to stay with you?"

### ND Adaptation

- **Sensory-friendly setup:** Low lighting, no fluorescent bulbs; soft textures only; minimal visual clutter
- **Noise management:** Include noise-reducing headphones; locate away from loud areas
- **Proprioceptive options:** Add weighted lap pad, resistance bands, or chew toys
- **Visual supports:** Use picture cards for strategies rather than written lists

### Twin Dynamics

- Consider: two corners, or two kits, or one shared space with two zones
- "You both get your own calm-down corner"
- Model taking turns if they want the same space

## Sibling Twist

When both kids are upset during a conflict:

> **Don't try to coach both at once. Stabilize one, then the other.**

Practical approach:
1. Quick safety check (everyone okay physically?)
2. Go to the more escalated child first (or the one less likely to hurt themselves/others while waiting)
3. Quick co-regulation: "I see you. I'm going to help your sibling first, then I'm coming to you."
4. Once one is calmer, switch

If you have a partner or helper: divide and conquer.

**After both are calmer:**
- "That was hard. Everyone was upset."
- Problem-solving comes later, when they're regulated

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> You co-regulate during a meltdown at least sometimes — not fixing, just being present.

Not perfectly calm. Not every meltdown. Just... you stayed. You didn't send them away. You offered your presence.

If that feels impossible after a week, stay on Step 6. This is hard. You're changing deep patterns.

If all you manage this step is **one meltdown where you stayed and didn't yell**, that's success for Step 6.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't stay calm enough to co-regulate"

You don't have to be perfectly calm. "Okay-enough" is enough. If you can:
- Not yell
- Not leave (unless you need to for safety)
- Keep your body relatively relaxed

That's co-regulation. Your internal state can be a mess.

If you're too flooded:
1. Say: "I need to calm my brain. I'll be right back."
2. Take 60 seconds (splash water, breathe)
3. Return

### "My presence makes it worse"

Some kids (especially ND kids) genuinely regulate better alone. This isn't rejection — it's self-knowledge.

Try:
- Sitting further away
- Not making eye contact
- Saying less (or nothing)
- Offering space explicitly: "I'll be right outside. Call me when you want me."

### "They say they want strategies but then reject all of them"

In the moment: stop offering. Just be present.

Later (when calm): "What WOULD help when you're that upset?" or "Let's pick two things for next time."

Often the strategy they choose isn't one you would have suggested.

### "I don't have space for a calm-down corner"

The calm-down kit is your backup. A small box under a bed works.

Or designate an existing space: "When we need to calm down, we sit on THIS couch" (with a blanket and comfort item stored there).
