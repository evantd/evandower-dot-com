**Phase:** 4 — Boundaries, Siblings, Problem-Solving  
**Duration:** 1 week minimum (repeat if needed)

---

## The One Thing

> **This step, you hold a boundary without yelling or caving — while staying present.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. When you set a limit, stay calm and stay there. "I'm here with you."

If all you do this step is use one of these scripts once, that counts.

You're entering Phase 4: all your play, choices, and descriptive noticing still count — this step is what you do when those aren't enough.

> **Remember the order:**
> 1. Check brain states — flooded or receptive? (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first, name & validate feelings (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: this step's tool

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Hold boundaries calmly; use "Two Things Are True" | Throughout day |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Pick one wobbly boundary and practice holding it once | 1-2 min |
| **3. Environment** | Implement "one in, one out" for toys/stuff | 20 min once |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Say one calm safety phrase ("I won't let you hit" **or** "I'm going to keep everyone safe") once this week — without repeating
- **1-2 minutes:** Identify your wobbliest boundary
- **20 minutes once this step:** Do the "one in, one out" review

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** (Track 1 is core) and call it a win.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 10 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

Kids test boundaries because they NEED to know the walls are solid. When limits wobble — when you cave after pushback, or explode instead of holding — kids feel less safe, not more free.

**Sturdy leadership** means:
- You know what's non-negotiable
- You state it calmly
- You don't argue during a meltdown
- You stay present through their upset

**This isn't rigidity.** It's calm confidence. The limit is the limit. AND you're still here for them emotionally.

> **Buddhist Lens (Optional):** This is *equanimity* and *allowing struggle*. You're a mountain while weather changes around you — sturdy, present, not swept away by their storm. Brave Parenting calls this "building moccasins": when you hold a boundary and tolerate their upset, you're allowing the safe struggle that grows resilience. The goal isn't a smooth trail today, but a more skilled climber over time. See [Buddhist Lens](/parenting/companions/buddhist-lens/) for more.
>
> **ND guardrail:** For ND kids, "allowing struggle" never means removing needed accommodations — only manageable challenges *within* their window of tolerance, with you as their secure base.
>
> **Waldorf Lens (Optional):** Waldorf calls this "loving authority" — the warm, steady adult whose calm confidence helps children feel safe. Think of yourself as the captain of the ship: clear, warm, and in charge. See [Waldorf Lens](/parenting/companions/waldorf-lens/) for more.
>
> **ND guardrail:** Some ND kids (especially PDA profiles) experience even gentle authority as threat; adjust firmness and use more collaborative language if you see spikes in panic or aggression.

### What This Changes

Once you internalize "hold and stay," you stop:
- Repeating yourself (and getting louder)
- Arguing about the rule during the meltdown
- Caving because you can't take the screaming
- Feeling guilty for having limits

You start:
- Stating the limit once
- Acting (not talking)
- Staying present through the feelings
- Reconnecting after

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Holding Boundaries with "Two Things Are True"

### The Two Tools

**1. "Two Things Are True" — Your Default Script**
This is your go-to for most limits. It acknowledges their want AND holds the boundary.

Formula:
> "You want ___. AND it's time to ___."
> "You wish you could ___. AND we need to ___."

The AND is key — it's not BUT. Both things are real.

**For ND and PDA kids especially**, this may be the only script you need. It validates without triggering demand-resistance.

**2. "I Won't Let You" — Optional, Safety-Only**
A calm, clear statement for physical safety situations (hitting, running into traffic, etc.).

**Important:** Many ND/PDA kids escalate when they hear "I won't let you." If that's your child, skip this phrase entirely — use "I'm going to keep everyone safe" or just act without words. See the **ND Adaptation** section below.

Formula:
> "I won't let you [hit/hurt/throw]. I'm here with you."
> "I'm going to keep you safe."

### "Two Things Are True" Examples

| Situation | Script |
|-----------|--------|
| Doesn't want to leave park | "You want to keep playing. AND it's time to go home." |
| Wants another cookie | "You wish you could have more. AND we're done with cookies for now." |
| Doesn't want bath | "You want to keep playing. AND it's bath time." |
| Wants screen time | "You wish you could watch more. AND screens are done for today." |
| Doesn't want to share | "You want to keep it. AND your sister gets a turn too." |

### "I Won't Let You" Examples

| Situation | Script |
|-----------|--------|
| Hitting | "I won't let you hit. I'm here with you." |
| Throwing things | "I won't let you throw. I'm going to keep everyone safe." |
| Hurting sibling | "I won't let you hurt Lila. I'm here." |
| Running in parking lot | "I won't let you run here. I'm going to hold your hand." |
| Hitting (PDA-sensitive) | "I'm going to help your body be safe." (block/step between without extra words) |

If "I won't let you" makes things worse, you can skip those words and just help their body be safe.

### The Boundary-Holding Sequence

1. **Decide your non-negotiables** — Know what you're not willing to budge on (safety, sleep time, hitting)
   - These are your "most of the time" limits. It's okay if there are rare exceptions when you consciously choose to flex.
2. **State calmly** — Say it once, in a normal voice
3. **Act** — Pick up, move, remove, redirect. Don't explain or repeat during meltdown
4. **Stay present** — "I'm here with you." "I know this is hard."
5. **Don't explain/argue during meltdown** — Words don't compute when flooded. Save teaching for later.

### Age Adaptations

**For 2-year-olds (twins):**

| Situation | Script | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Hitting sibling | "I won't let you hit." | Move their body gently away |
| Throwing food | "Food stays on the plate." | Remove plate calmly |
| Running from diaper change | "It's diaper time." | Calmly pick up, bring to changing area |
| Screaming for tablet | "You want more. AND tablet time is over." | Stay nearby, let them feel it |

- They will melt down. That's normal.
- You stay calm and present. That's the skill.
- Very few words needed. Actions speak.

**For 6-year-old:**

| Situation | Script | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Wanting more screen time | "You wish you could watch more. AND screens are done." | Turn it off (or have it auto-off) |
| Not wanting to do homework | "You don't want to do this. AND homework happens before play." | Stay nearby, don't engage in argument |
| Hitting when angry | "I won't let you hit. I'm here." | Block or move away, stay present |
| Negotiating bedtime | "You want to stay up. AND bedtime is now." | Start routine, don't debate. Use the bedtime routine you built in Step 9 as your anchor here. |

- She may argue, negotiate, or say "it's not fair"
- You: "I hear you. AND for today, this is the limit."
- Don't JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain) during the upset

**Twin dynamics:**
- One twin's boundary pushback may set off the other — that's okay
- You might need to physically hold a limit with one while the other watches
- Keep statements short: "I won't let either of you hit."

### ND Adaptation

**"I won't let you" may escalate PDA kids.** Try instead:
- "I'm going to help your body calm down."
- "I'm going to keep everyone safe."
- Less directive framing: "We're all going to pause."

**Transition warnings help:** Give 5-10 minute heads up before the boundary kicks in.
- "In 5 minutes, screens turn off."
- "Two more times down the slide, then we go."

**Visual schedules** can reduce verbal battles — the schedule says what's next, not you.

**Shutdown vs. meltdown:** If your child goes quiet/shut down instead of melting down, they're still flooded. Stay present: "I'm here. Take your time."

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Hold One Wobbly Boundary

**Time:** 1-2 minutes reflection + one practice opportunity  
**Goal:** Identify your weakest boundary and practice holding it calmly once this step

### The Practice

1. **Identify your wobbliest limit** — Where do you usually cave? Where do you yell instead of hold?
   - Screen time extensions?
   - One more cookie/one more book?
   - Hitting (you intervene but then let it go)?
   - Bedtime pushback?

2. **Decide what you're going to do** — Not just what you'll say, but what you'll DO.
   - Turn off the TV yourself
   - Pick them up and carry to bath
   - Remove the object
   - Stay in the room but stop talking

Write this one limit on a sticky note or phone note (e.g., "screens end at 7"). When it comes up, you're not deciding from scratch — you're just following the note.

3. **When the moment comes:**
   - State the limit once
   - Act
   - Stay present through the upset
   - Repair afterward if needed ("That was hard. I'm here.")

### Why This Specific Practice

One boundary, one time. You're practicing the FEELING of holding without caving or exploding.

You won't be perfect. You might wobble. You might get louder than you wanted. That's data.

If you forget in the moment, that's okay — noticing afterward ("Ah, that was my wobbly boundary") is still progress.

### ND Adaptation

If holding limits triggers your own shame spiral or rejection sensitivity:
- This is a practice, not a test
- "Okay-enough" is the goal
- If you cave, you can repair: "I changed my mind and I realize that was confusing"

If your child's distress is overwhelming to you:
- It's okay to step away briefly (if safe)
- Their distress doesn't mean you did something wrong

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: One In, One Out

**Time:** 20 minutes once this step  
**Goal:** Maintain the simplicity gains from earlier weeks

### The Concept

You decluttered earlier. Now keep it from creeping back.

**One in, one out (most of the time):** When something new comes in, *aim* for something to go out.

### The Task

1. **Notice what's accumulated** — Birthday gifts? Hand-me-downs? Random stuff from grandparents?

2. **Choose items to release** — Equal to what came in (roughly)
   - Donate, store in a "vacation" box, or pass on to other families

3. **Make it a family norm (6-year-old can participate):**
   - "We got a new thing! What can we pass on to make space?"
   - This isn't punishment — it's "we keep space for what we love"

4. **For toys the kids won't let go:**
   - Vacation box (out of sight, bring back in a month if they ask)
   - No need to force it

This is about space and ease, not consequences. If it becomes a battle, pause and try again another time.

### Why This Matters

- Fewer things = fewer conflicts over things
- Maintains the calm environment you built
- Models intentionality

## Sibling Twist

Boundaries with siblings need extra clarity:

**Both kids get the same rule:**
- "I won't let anyone hit anyone in this family."
- "We don't take things from people's hands."

**Stay neutral-ish:**
- You don't have to figure out who started it
- "I see two upset kids. What happened?" (if both are receptive)
- If someone's flooded, calm first, investigate later

**Two Things Are True for sibling wants:**
- "You want the toy. AND your sister is using it."
- "You want to play alone. AND we share the playroom."

**After boundary holding:**
- "That was hard for both of you. Let's figure this out."
- **Structured** sibling problem-solving comes in Step 12 — for now, just hold the line

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> You hold a boundary without yelling or caving — at least sometimes. And you stay present through the upset.

Not every time. Not perfectly. Just... sometimes you feel yourself holding, not collapsing or exploding, and staying in the room.

70% is good enough. If you're doing this some of the time and more than you used to, that's success.

If every limit still ends in yelling or caving, stay on Step 10.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "When I hold the limit, they melt down and I can't stand it"

That's co-regulation stress. Their dysregulation dysregulates you.

Remember:
- Their upset doesn't mean you did something wrong
- You can feel your feelings AND hold the limit
- It's okay to be quiet. You don't have to narrate or use the perfect script — calm-ish presence is enough.

If it's overwhelming:
- "I'm going to step away for one minute. I'll be right back."
- Return when you're okay-enough

### "I said 'I won't let you' and they escalated MORE"

This happens, especially with PDA profiles.

Try:
- Softer language: "I'm going to help your body calm down"
- Less words, more action: Just gently move/block without narrating
- Validate first, then limit: "You really want that. AND I can't let you throw."

### "I keep caving because the meltdown goes on forever"

How long is "forever"? Sometimes 15-20 minutes feels like an hour.

Check: Are you caving because it's genuinely unsafe, or because it's unbearable?

If unsafe → of course, adjust  
If unbearable → that's the practice. Sit with it. "I'm here. I know this is hard."

Sometimes kids need to know you can handle their big feelings. When we often change the limit to stop a meltdown, kids may learn that their upset *might* change the rule, which makes limits feel less solid.

### "My partner/co-parent doesn't hold the same limits"

Different boundaries between caregivers is confusing but survivable.

Start with: "When I'M here, this is the limit." You can only control yourself.

Later, when you have bandwidth, align on 2-3 non-negotiables (safety stuff).

**If your partner undercuts or escalates your boundary in front of kids:**
- Don't argue philosophy mid-moment
- Script: "We see this a bit differently. For now we'll go with [my] plan, and we'll talk later."
- Actually talk later — use the NVC structure from Step 15

See the **[Co-Parenting Guide](/parenting/companions/co-parenting-guide/)** for more on disagreeing without making each other the enemy.
