**Phase:** 5 — Advanced Autonomy (Extension)  
**Duration:** 2 weeks minimum (this is a big one)

## The One Thing

> **This step, you learn to solve recurring problems WITH your child — not FOR them or TO them.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. Pick one recurring problem and have a full Plan B conversation (see Track 1) instead of defaulting to consequences.

> **Remember the order:**
> 1. Check brain states — flooded or receptive? (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first, name & validate feelings (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: this step's tool

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Full Plan B conversation (6-year-old) + micro-practice runs (twins) | 15-20 min conversation + 3-5 day trial |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Identify one problem you've been "solving" with consequences | Reflection + one attempt |
| **3. Environment** | Create problem-solving time in your weekly rhythm | 10 min weekly slot |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** When a recurring problem happens, say: "We need to figure this out together. Let's talk later when we're both calm."
- **15-20 minutes:** Have one Plan B conversation with your 6-year-old
- **10 minutes weekly:** Establish a regular "figuring things out" time

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** — Track 1 is the core skill.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 13 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

Ross Greene's research shows that kids do well when they can. When they can't, there's usually a **lagging skill** — not a motivation problem.

Traditional approaches:
- "If I make the consequence painful enough, they'll behave" → Actually makes things worse
- "They know better, they just need to try harder" → Assumes capability that may not be there

Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) / Plan B:
- Assumes good intentions: "What's getting in the way?"
- Identifies the underlying skill gap
- Solves the problem WITH the child, building their capacity

Kids who experience collaborative problem-solving:
- Develop an internal "I can figure this out" muscle
- Learn that their perspective matters
- Build the actual skills they were missing
- Have fewer challenging behaviors over time

### What This Changes

Step 12 introduced basic problem-solving (one small issue, brief brainstorm). This step goes deeper:

| Step 12 | Step 13 |
|---------|-------------|
| One-time issue | Recurring problems |
| Brief brainstorm | Full 7-step Plan B |
| "What should we try?" | "What's getting in the way for you?" |
| Quick solution | Trial period + reassessment |

Once you internalize Plan B:
- You stop assuming your child "won't" and start asking "can't yet"
- Recurring problems get addressed at the root, not the surface
- Your 6-year-old develops problem-solving as a life skill
- Power struggles decrease because you're on the same team

---

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Plan B Conversations

### What's Different from Step 12

Step 12 gave you simple problem-solving: notice a problem, brainstorm, try something. That works for everyday friction.

Plan B is for **recurring, stuck problems** — the ones where you've tried consequences, incentives, and reminders, and nothing has worked. These usually involve a **lagging skill** (flexibility, frustration tolerance, problem-solving ability itself).

### The Plan B Structure (7 Steps)

This is for when everyone is CALM — not during the problem.

| Step | What to Say | What You're Doing |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1. **Empathy** | "I've noticed that mornings are really hard. What's going on for you?" | Gathering information, showing you want to understand |
| 2. **Dig deeper** | "Tell me more about that..." / "What makes that hard?" | Uncovering the lagging skill or unsolved problem |
| 3. **Reflect back** | "So you're saying... [their concern]" | Making sure they feel heard |
| 4. **Define your concern** | "The thing is, when we're late, I get stressed and work gets harder." | Stating your side without blame |
| 5. **Invitation** | "I wonder if there's a way we could figure this out together so both of our concerns are addressed." | Signaling collaboration, not imposition |
| 6. **Brainstorm** | "What ideas do you have?" Write down ALL ideas — even silly ones. | Both of you contribute; don't evaluate yet |
| 7. **Evaluate & try** | "Which ones might actually work for both of us?" Commit to testing for 3-5 days. | Pick something realistic and doable |

**Then:** Reassess after the trial. "How did our plan work? Do we need to adjust?"

### Key Mindset Shifts

**From "won't" to "can't yet":**
- The child isn't being defiant — they're lacking a skill
- Your job is to understand what skill, then build it together

**From "my solution" to "our solution":**
- If you already know what you want them to do, that's not Plan B — that's Plan A with extra steps
- Be genuinely open to their ideas, even if they're different from yours

**From "fix it now" to "solve it durably":**
- Plan B takes longer upfront but prevents the same battle 100 more times
- A solution that doesn't work is just data for the next iteration

### Example Plan B Conversation

**Problem:** Morning battles about getting dressed

> **Parent:** "Hey, can we talk about mornings? I've noticed they've been really hard lately. What's going on for you when it's time to get dressed?"
>
> **Child:** "I don't know. I just don't want to."
>
> **Parent:** "Hmm, tell me more. What happens when I say it's time to get dressed?"
>
> **Child:** "I want to keep playing. And my clothes are scratchy."
>
> **Parent:** "So there are two things — you want to keep playing, and the clothes don't feel good. Is that right?"
>
> **Child:** "Yeah."
>
> **Parent:** "That makes sense. Here's my concern: when we're late, I feel stressed and sometimes I get grumpy, and then we both start the day upset. I wonder if we can figure out something that works for both of us?"
>
> **Child:** "I could wear pajamas to school."
>
> **Parent:** *(writing it down)* "Okay, that's one idea. What else?"
>
> **Child:** "Um... you could pick out softer clothes?"
>
> **Parent:** "Good one. I have an idea too — what if we picked out clothes the night before, so there's no deciding in the morning?"
>
> **Child:** "Yeah! And then I get 5 more minutes of play."
>
> **Parent:** "Let's look at these. Pajamas to school probably won't work for your teacher. But the soft clothes and picking them out at night — and maybe a timer for 5 minutes of play — those might work. Which should we try?"
>
> **Child:** "Pick clothes at night and the timer."
>
> **Parent:** "Okay, let's try that for the next 4 mornings and see how it goes."

### Age-Specific Guidance

**For 6-year-old:**

| Situation | Plan B Focus |
|-----------|--------------|
| Morning battles | What makes mornings hard? What would help? |
| Screen time ending | What happens in your brain when I say "time's up"? |
| Homework avoidance | What's the hardest part about homework? |
| Sibling conflicts | When do you feel like you need to hit/grab? |

Tips:
- Keep sessions under 15-20 minutes — her attention will wane
- Try walking and talking, or drawing while talking
- Write down ideas (or draw them) so she feels heard
- Follow through on the reassessment — this builds trust

**For 2-year-olds (twins):**

They're too young for Plan B conversations. Their prefrontal cortex can't do this kind of abstract problem-solving yet.

Instead, continue from Step 12:

| Skill-Building Approach | Example |
|-------------------------|---------|
| **Micro-choices** | "Red cup or blue cup?" |
| **Practice runs** | "Let's practice: when I say 'shoes', you say 'okay' and walk to your shoes!" |
| **Environmental setup** | Remove triggers, add supports, simplify choices |
| **Pattern observation** | YOU figure out the lagging skill and scaffold for it |

When twins are 4-5, you can start very simple Plan B conversations. For now, you're the one doing the problem-solving on their behalf.

### ND Adaptation

**Some ND kids need the problem named explicitly:**
- "Your brain gets stuck on transitions — that's not your fault, it's just how your brain works"
- "Some brains have a hard time switching from fun stuff to hard stuff"
- Naming the skill gap reduces shame and increases collaboration

**Visual supports for brainstorming:**
- Write or draw every idea on sticky notes
- Let them move ideas around, cross things out physically
- Some kids can't brainstorm verbally but can draw or build with LEGO

**Extended timelines:**
- Neurotypical kids might adapt to a new plan in 3-5 days
- ND kids may need 2-3 weeks for a new strategy to stick
- Don't give up too early — track patterns, not individual days

**PDA considerations:**
- Frame as "figuring things out together" not "solving a problem"
- Avoid any sense that this is a disguised demand
- Let them lead the brainstorming as much as possible
- Accept more "silly" ideas before evaluating

**Processing time:**
- Give 24+ hours notice: "Tomorrow let's talk about the morning thing"
- Allow pauses — silence doesn't mean refusal
- Some kids need to come back to it after sleeping on it

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Replace Consequences with Curiosity

**Time:** Reflection + one attempt  
**Goal:** Identify where you've been defaulting to consequences and try Plan B instead

### The Practice

1. **Identify a recurring problem** where your current approach isn't working:
   - Time-outs that aren't changing behavior
   - Taking away screen time/toys as punishment
   - Repeated warnings that escalate to yelling
   - Natural consequences that haven't taught the lesson

2. **Ask yourself the key question:**
   > "What skill is my child lacking that would make this easier?"

   Common lagging skills:
   - Frustration tolerance
   - Flexibility when plans change
   - Problem-solving when stuck
   - Impulse control
   - Transitioning between activities
   - Considering others' perspectives

3. **Schedule a Plan B conversation:**
   - Pick a calm moment (not during or right after the problem)
   - Give advance notice: "I'd like to talk about [X] later today"
   - Be genuinely curious — you might learn something you didn't expect

4. **Notice your pull toward Plan A:**
   - Plan A = imposing your will (consequences, threats, rewards)
   - Plan B = collaborative problem-solving
   - Plan C = dropping the expectation for now (not every battle is worth fighting)

   You'll feel the pull toward Plan A. That's normal. The practice is noticing it and choosing differently.

### Why This Specific Practice

You're retraining your own nervous system. When problems arise, most of us default to control (make them comply) or capitulation (give up).

Plan B is a third path: "We're going to solve this together, and I trust that you have important information I don't have."

This is hard. You might slip into lecture mode ("But the REASON we need to leave on time is..."). You might push your preferred solution. That's data, not failure.

### ND Adaptation (for parents)

If you have ADHD:
- Write down the 7 steps on a card before the conversation
- It's okay to pause and check your notes: "Hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this right"

If you're prone to flooding:
- Schedule Plan B for a time when you have bandwidth
- If you feel yourself getting activated, pause: "I need a minute to think"

If solutions feel urgent to you:
- Plan B takes longer now but saves time later
- Remind yourself: "We're building a skill, not just solving today's problem"

---

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: Problem-Solving Time

**Time:** 10 minutes once per week  
**Goal:** Create a predictable slot for addressing problems when you're not in crisis

### The Setup

Pick a weekly time that's:
- When everyone is fed, rested, and calm
- Not competing with something fun (not right before screen time)
- Consistent (same time each week if possible)

Good options:
- Sunday evening after dinner
- Saturday morning with pancakes
- Wednesday after school, before any activities

### The Structure

This is different from the weekly check-in (Step 12). That was about general highs/lows. This is specifically for **recurring problems**.

Keep it SHORT (10 minutes max) and LOW-KEY:

1. **"Is there anything that's been hard lately?"** (Each person, including you)
2. **Pick ONE thing to work on** (not everything at once)
3. **Do a quick Plan B** or schedule a longer conversation if needed
4. **Review last week's plan** — "How did our plan work? Do we need to adjust?"

### Age Adaptations

| 6-Year-Old | 2-Year-Old Twins |
|------------|------------------|
| Can identify problems and brainstorm | Can be present but won't participate meaningfully |
| May have her own agenda for what to discuss | Might distract from conversation |
| Can understand "trying something for a week" | Need you to observe and solve on their behalf |

For the twins: They can sit with you during problem-solving time, but the real work is between you and your 6-year-old (or between co-parents).

### If It Doesn't Fit

Some families prefer informal problem-solving (in the car, at bedtime, on walks) over scheduled time. That's fine.

The point isn't the structure — it's that problems get addressed proactively, not just reactively.

### Visual Supports

Create a "problems we're working on" board:
- Post-it notes with current problems
- Move to "solved" or "still working on it"
- Let the 6-year-old add to it during the week
- Review together during problem-solving time

---

## Sibling Twist

Plan B works for sibling problems too — but with a key difference:

**Individual Plan B first:** Talk to each child separately about their perspective before bringing them together.

**Example: Recurring conflict over shared toys**

With 6-year-old alone:
> "I've noticed you and [twin] fight over the LEGO a lot. What's hard about sharing it?"

With twins (observational):
> Watch for patterns. What triggers the conflict? What do they actually want?

Then, if 6-year-old is ready:
> "You want uninterrupted building time. [Twin] wants to play with you. I want the fighting to stop. What might work?"

**Solutions might include:**
- Special LEGO time when twins are napping
- A "building in progress" sign that means "don't touch"
- Specific "together LEGO" vs "solo LEGO"

For twins-with-twins conflicts: You're still solving on their behalf. Observe patterns, make environmental changes, and scaffold their emerging skills.

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> You can complete a Plan B conversation without slipping into "my solution" mode — staying genuinely curious about their perspective and open to ideas you didn't expect.

Not every time. Not with every problem. But when a problem recurs, your first instinct shifts from "How do I make them stop?" to "What's getting in the way, and how can we solve this together?"

If Plan B conversations keep turning into lectures or negotiations where you're pushing your answer, stay on Step 13.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My child won't talk / says 'I don't know'"

**"I don't know" often means:**
- They need more time to think
- They're worried about getting in trouble
- They genuinely don't have words for it yet

Try:
- Guessing: "I wonder if maybe... [possible concern]?"
- Making it safe: "There's no wrong answer. I really want to understand."
- Giving time: "Let's come back to this tomorrow."
- Different format: "Can you draw what mornings feel like?"

### "We did Plan B and nothing changed"

Plan B isn't magic. It might take:
- Multiple conversations to understand the real problem
- Trying several solutions before one sticks
- Longer trial periods (especially for ND kids)
- Addressing a different underlying issue

Also check:
- Was the solution realistic and specific?
- Did you actually follow through on the reassessment?
- Did YOU stick to the plan, or did you slip back to old patterns?

### "I keep taking over the brainstorm"

This is the hardest part. You have more experience and ideas feel obvious to you.

Practice:
- Wait longer before contributing
- Ask "What else?" two more times before offering your ideas
- Present your ideas as questions: "What would happen if we..."
- Let them pick the final solution even if it's not your favorite

### "This takes too long — we don't have 20 minutes"

You're right that Plan B takes time upfront. But so does:
- The same argument every morning for months
- Escalating consequences that don't work
- The emotional toll of constant conflict

Think of Plan B as an investment. One 20-minute conversation might prevent hundreds of 2-minute battles.

If time is genuinely scarce:
- Schedule one Plan B per week during problem-solving time
- Keep conversations shorter but come back to them
- Prioritize: Which problem is costing the most time/energy right now?
