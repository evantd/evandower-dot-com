## The One Thing

> **This step, you give yourself the care you've been giving your kids.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. Schedule ONE thing this week that's only for you — a walk, a bath, 15 minutes of silence — and protect it.

> **This step is different:**
> 
> There's no child skill here. This is 100% parent-focused. You've learned to regulate your kids, connect before correcting, name their feelings, hold boundaries, and repair ruptures. Now you turn those same skills inward.
>
> Self-empathy is not selfishness. It's the foundation that sustains everything else.

> **When you're with your kids, the same sequence still applies:**
> 1. Check brain states (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: whatever tool you're using
>
> This step focuses on what you do *with yourself* between those moments.

> **Overwhelmed? Do the 2-minute version and ignore the rest.**
>
> 1. Once a day, notice one body sensation (tight chest, clenched jaw, etc.).
> 2. Whisper: "This is hard. It makes sense I'm struggling."
> 3. Ask: "What do I need right now?" (Rest? Space? Food?) and take one tiny step.
>
> Everything else in this step is optional depth.

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Parent Skill** | Deep self-empathy practice | 2-5 min when struggling |
| **2. Parent Mini-Practice** | Should → Choose translation | 30 seconds per instance |
| **3. Environment Mini-Project** | Protect one thing for yourself | Schedule this week |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Notice one sensation in your body right now. That's it.
- **2 minutes:** Run through the 6-step self-empathy check-in (Track 1)
- **30 seconds:** Catch one "should" and translate it to "choose"

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** — Track 3 (protecting one thing) might be the most transformative because it's concrete and hard to skip.

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

Parent burnout is real. Research shows that:

1. **Burnout predicts harsher parenting.** When you're depleted, all the skills you've learned become harder to access.

2. **Self-compassion predicts resilience.** Parents who treat themselves with kindness recover faster from hard moments.

3. **Modeling matters.** Kids learn self-care by watching you practice it, not from lectures about it.

If you've been running on empty, you haven't "failed" — you've been surviving. Now we build sustainability.

### Optional Deep Dive: Why This Works

*Skip to Track 1 if you just want the practice.*

#### The Stress Cycle

Here's something most people don't know: **dealing with the stressor is not the same as dealing with the stress.**

Your body doesn't know what "resolved the scheduling conflict" or "got the kids to bed" means. It only knows whether the stress response cycle completed. When you face a stressor, your body floods with stress hormones preparing you to fight or flee. But in modern life, you can't run from your toddler or punch your to-do list — so the stress response gets activated but never *completed*.

**The stress stays in your body even after the stressor is gone.**

This is why you can "solve" a problem and still feel terrible. Why you can finally get the kids to bed and still have your shoulders up by your ears. The situation is handled, but your nervous system is still waiting for the "all clear."

> "Dealing with your stress is a separate process from dealing with the things that cause your stress. To deal with your stress, you have to complete the cycle." — Emily & Amelia Nagoski

**Signs your stress cycles aren't completing:**
- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Getting sick after stressful periods end
- Snapping at small things
- Feeling stuck or numb
- Tension that won't release

#### The Two Arrows

The Buddha used a powerful metaphor: when something painful happens, it's like being hit by an arrow. That's the **first arrow** — unavoidable pain that comes with being human.

But then we react. We criticize ourselves, catastrophize, replay the moment, tell ourselves we're failing. Each of these thoughts causes more pain. That's the **second arrow** — the one we shoot at ourselves.

> "First arrows are inevitable. Second arrows are optional."

**Examples of second arrows:**
- Child melts down → "I'm a terrible parent" (second arrow)
- Partner snaps at you → "They don't appreciate anything I do" (second arrow)
- You yell → "What's wrong with me?" (second arrow)

The second arrow often hurts more than the first. And we can learn to stop shooting it.

Self-empathy is about noticing the first arrow (the pain), and choosing not to add the second (the self-attack).

#### What This Changes

Once you practice self-empathy:
- You catch depletion earlier, before it becomes explosion
- You stop the shame spiral that follows every mistake
- You model for your kids that adults take care of themselves
- You have more to give because you're not running on fumes

## Track 1 – Parent Skill: Deep Self-Empathy

This is not a child skill. This is yours.

### When to Use It

When you notice:
- Rising resentment ("I do EVERYTHING around here")
- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Snapping over small things
- Hopelessness ("Nothing I do works")
- Physical tension: tight chest, clenched jaw, shallow breathing

### The 6-Step Self-Empathy Check-In

| Step | Practice | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1. **Pause** | "Something's happening in me" | Stop. Don't fix anything yet. |
| 2. **Notice sensations** | Where is it in your body? | "Tight chest, clenched jaw, shoulders up by my ears" |
| 3. **Name feeling** | Use a real feeling word (not "fine") | "I'm feeling resentful... exhausted... hopeless" |
| 4. **Identify need** | What need is unmet? (See list below) | "I need rest. I need appreciation. I need autonomy." |
| 5. **Mourn if needed** | Allow grief without fixing | "It makes sense I'm struggling. This is genuinely hard." |
| 6. **Request** | One small thing you can do for this need | "Can I ask my partner for 20 minutes alone tonight?" |

### The Needs List (Partial)

When you're struggling, there's always an unmet need underneath. Common ones for parents:

| Category | Needs |
|----------|-------|
| **Physical** | Rest, food, movement, touch, space |
| **Autonomy** | Choice, independence, solitude, control over own time |
| **Connection** | Appreciation, understanding, companionship, to be seen |
| **Meaning** | Contribution, purpose, competence, to matter |
| **Safety** | Predictability, stability, order, peace |

If you can't identify the need, guess. "I think I need... rest? Space? To feel competent?" Guessing is fine.

### The Key Distinction: Mourning vs. Self-Judgment

| Self-Judgment (Creates suffering) | Mourning (Creates movement) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| "I'm such a terrible parent" | "I'm sad I yelled. I value gentleness." |
| "I should be able to handle this" | "I'm disappointed. I want to be more patient." |
| "What's wrong with me?" | "I'm grieving that I didn't have the capacity tonight." |
| Creates shame → paralysis | Creates sadness → motivation to change |

Self-judgment says: "I'm bad."  
Mourning says: "I care about this, and I missed the mark."

### Anger as Information

When anger arises, don't fight it or shame yourself for it.

**The reframe:**
- Anger is a signal of unmet needs, not evidence of bad character
- Behind anger: usually unmet needs for respect, autonomy, fairness, or rest

**The practice:**
1. Notice the anger: "I'm angry"
2. Name the judgmental thought: "I'm telling myself they don't appreciate anything I do"
3. Translate to need: "I need appreciation. I need to feel like my contribution matters."

> "When we become aware of our needs, anger gives way to life-serving feelings." — Marshall Rosenberg

### Alternative: The Four Steps (Mindfulness-Based)

If the 6-step NVC check-in feels too verbal or cognitive, try this simpler, body-based approach:

| Step | Practice |
|------|----------|
| 1. **Recognize** | "I'm suffering right now." (Just notice it.) |
| 2. **Drop the story** | Let go of the thoughts about *why* or *whose fault*. |
| 3. **Turn toward** | Feel the pain in your body. Be curious about it. Where is it? |
| 4. **Offer kindness** | Place a hand there. "I'm here. This is hard." |

This approach comes from Buddhist self-compassion practice. It's less about naming feelings and needs, more about *being with* the pain without adding to it.

**When to use this instead of the 6-step check-in:**
- When you're too flooded for words
- When naming feelings triggers more thinking
- When you just need to be held (by yourself)

> "Your pain deserves compassion. We offer kindness to our pain not to banish it, but simply because it needs kindness." — Bodhipaksa

### ND Adaptation

**If interoception is low** (you don't notice body sensations easily):
- Use external cues: "My heart rate is elevated. My jaw is tight."
- Try body-based practices BEFORE verbal processing: pressure (weighted blanket, tight hug), movement (walk, shake), cold water on face
- It's okay if you only get to "something is wrong" without naming the feeling precisely
- The Four Steps approach (above) may work better than the verbal NVC check-in

**If you tend toward excessive rumination:**
- Set a timer for self-empathy (2-3 minutes max)
- Write it down to externalize: "I'm feeling ___ because I need ___"
- Then move your body — don't let it become a thought spiral
- If naming feelings leads to more stories, try the Four Steps instead — focus on *dropping* the story

**If verbal processing feels performative:**
- Physical self-empathy counts: pressure, weighted blanket, rocking, hot bath
- The Four Steps approach emphasizes body and presence over words
- The goal is CARE, not specific words

### Example Self-Empathy Moments

**Evening resentment:**
> "I notice my shoulders are up by my ears. I'm feeling resentful. I've been giving all day and I need... rest. I need to feel like I matter beyond what I do for others. Okay. One small thing: I'm going to ask for 20 minutes alone after bedtime."

**After yelling:**
> "I yelled. I'm feeling ashamed... no, wait — that's judgment. Let me mourn instead. I'm feeling sad. I value speaking gently to my kids, and I didn't do that. It makes sense I'm struggling — I'm running on no sleep. What do I need? Rest. Support. What's one thing? I'll go to bed when the kids do tonight."

**Frustration with partner:**
> "I'm angry. The thought is 'they never help.' Behind that: I need fairness. I need to feel like we're a team. One request I can make: 'Can we talk about dividing the bedtime routine?'"

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Should → Choose Translation

**Time:** 30 seconds per instance  
**Goal:** Reclaim agency and reduce guilt

### The Problem with "Should"

"Should" language creates guilt and resentment:
- "I should be more patient" → implies you're failing
- "I have to make dinner" → implies no choice, breeds resentment
- "I shouldn't yell" → focuses on what's wrong with you

Human beings resist demands — even internal ones. "Should" implies no choice and threatens autonomy.

### The Translation

| Should (creates guilt) | Choose (creates agency) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| "I should be more patient" | "I *want* to be more patient because connection matters to me" |
| "I have to make dinner" | "I *choose* to make dinner because feeding my family is important to me" |
| "I shouldn't yell" | "I *want* to find other ways to express my frustration" |
| "I should play with them more" | "I *want* to play with them because I value our connection" |
| "I have to go to work" | "I *choose* to work because providing for my family matters to me" |

### The Practice

1. **Catch the should:** Notice when you say or think "should," "have to," "ought to," "must"
2. **Pause:** Don't judge yourself for the should
3. **Translate:** "I choose to ___ because I value ___"

### What If You Don't Want To?

Sometimes when you translate, you discover you DON'T actually want to.

> "I have to go to this party" → "I choose to... wait. I don't want to. I'm going to avoid punishment/guilt."

That's useful information. You can then:
- Acknowledge the real motivation: "I'm choosing this to avoid conflict"
- Or reconsider: "Maybe I don't go"
- Or find the genuine want underneath: "I choose to go because I value my relationship with this friend"

### Dangerous Motivations

Watch for these reasons behind "have to" — they often signal resentment building:

| Motivation | What It Sounds Like |
|------------|---------------------|
| Avoid punishment | "If I don't, they'll be mad" |
| Avoid shame | "What would people think?" |
| Avoid guilt | "I'd feel terrible if I didn't" |
| Duty/obligation | "It's just what you're supposed to do" |

These aren't necessarily wrong, but they breed resentment over time. See if you can find a genuine *want* underneath, or acknowledge honestly that you're choosing to avoid a consequence.

### ND Adaptation

If this feels like semantic games:
- Focus on the FEELING shift, not the words
- Does saying "I choose" feel different in your body than "I have to"?
- If not, skip this practice — Track 1 or Track 3 may serve you better

---

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: Protect One Thing

**Time:** Schedule this week  
**Goal:** Prove to yourself that your needs matter — and complete the stress cycle

### The Practice

Schedule ONE thing this week that's only for you. Not for kids. Not for work. Not for your partner.

**Stress-Cycle-Completing Examples:**
- Physical movement (walk, dance, shake it out) — 20-60 min
- A long hug with someone safe (20 seconds, both standing)
- A big cry (with a sad movie if needed)
- Laughter — real belly laughs, not polite chuckles
- Creative expression (music, art, writing)
- Deep breathing (inhale 5, hold 5, exhale 10, pause 5 — repeat 3x)

**Other Self-Care Examples:**
- 30 minutes alone in a coffee shop
- Reading for pleasure (not parenting books)
- A bath after bedtime
- Calling a friend
- Doing nothing

**Why movement matters most:** Your body's stress response was designed for running from lions. When you move your body, you're speaking the language your nervous system understands. Physical activity is the most efficient way to complete the stress cycle.

### The Hard Part: Protecting It

Scheduling is easy. Protecting is hard.

**Protect it from:**
- Your own guilt ("I should be with the kids")
- Partner's needs ("Can you just quickly...")
- Kid emergencies that aren't emergencies
- The voice that says rest is lazy

**How to protect:**
1. Tell someone: "I have a commitment Thursday 7-8pm" (you don't have to explain it's self-care)
2. Put it in your calendar like a meeting
3. Have a backup plan if truly derailed — reschedule within 24 hours

### ND Adaptation

If scheduling feels overwhelming:
- Pick something that requires zero setup: sitting in the car alone for 10 minutes after arriving home
- Attach it to an existing routine: "After kids are in bed, before dishes, I sit for 5 minutes"

If you can't imagine what you'd do:
- Doing nothing IS the thing
- Staring at a wall counts
- The activity matters less than the boundary

### The Point

This isn't about the specific activity. It's about proving — to yourself and your family — that your needs exist and deserve protection.

If you can't do this one thing without guilt swallowing you, stay on this step. This IS the work.

---

## Sibling Twist

This step is parent-focused, so there's no sibling-specific content.

However, notice if sibling conflict is draining you more than other parenting challenges. If so:
- Revisit Step 11 (Sibling Safety Ladder) — are you intervening too early or too late?
- Use self-empathy when sibling noise triggers you: "I'm overwhelmed. I need quiet. One thing: I can use noise-canceling headphones for 10 minutes."

Your job is not to prevent all sibling conflict. Your job is to stay regulated enough to respond skillfully when needed.

---

## Mastery Indicator

> You can do a **self-empathy check-in without it becoming self-criticism**.

Not perfectly. Not every time. But when you notice you're struggling, you can turn toward yourself with curiosity ("What do I need?") rather than judgment ("What's wrong with me?").

70% is good enough. If you're doing this some of the time and more than you used to, that's success.

**Signs you've got this:**
- You catch depletion before it becomes explosion
- You can mourn a mistake without shame-spiraling
- You've protected at least one thing for yourself
- "Should" sometimes becomes "choose" in your head

**Signs you need more time here:**
- Self-empathy turns into rumination or self-attack
- You can't identify any needs (everything feels numb or "fine")
- Protecting time for yourself feels impossible or selfish
- Guilt consumes you after every parenting mistake

If self-empathy still spirals into shame, stay here. This is arguably the most important skill in the entire curriculum — the one that makes all the others sustainable.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Self-empathy turns into self-criticism"

This is the most common challenge. Watch for the pivot:

| Self-empathy | Self-criticism (stop here) |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| "I'm tired and need rest" | "Because I'm weak and can't handle normal parenting" |
| "I'm frustrated about the mess" | "Which means I'm a control freak" |
| "I need appreciation" | "I'm so needy" |

When you notice the pivot:
1. Stop the practice
2. Name what happened: "That turned into self-attack"
3. Offer simple care: "This is hard. I'm doing my best."
4. Move your body — don't stay in your head

### "I can't identify my feelings or needs"

This is common, especially with alexithymia (difficulty identifying emotions) or after years of ignoring your own needs.

Start with body sensations:
- "My chest is tight"
- "My shoulders are up"
- "I feel heavy"

Use the needs list as a menu — point at ones that resonate rather than generating them from scratch.

Over time, the vocabulary grows. Be patient.

### "Protecting time feels selfish"

You may be suffering from what researchers call **Human Giver Syndrome**: the internalized belief that your role is to give your time, attention, and energy to others — and that having needs of your own is a violation.

Symptoms include:
- Believing you don't deserve rest until everyone else's needs are met
- Feeling guilty when you do something for yourself
- Self-care feeling like yet another thing you're failing at
- A voice insisting self-preservation is selfish

> "Your body, with its instinct for self-preservation, knows that Human Giver Syndrome is slowly wearing you down. That's why you keep trying self-care trends. But that instinct is battling a syndrome that insists self-preservation is selfish." — Emily & Amelia Nagoski (paraphrased)

None of this is your fault. You inherited these expectations; you didn't choose them. Noticing them is the first step toward loosening their grip.

**The reframe:** You're not selfish for having needs. You've been trained to believe your needs don't count. That training is the problem, not your needs.

Notice the "should" underneath: "I should always be available."

Translate it: "I want to be available because connection matters to me. AND I need rest to be present when I am available."

Both can be true. Rest isn't selfish — it's maintenance. It's what keeps you alive to give another day.

### "I don't know what I'd do with time for myself"

That's data. You've been so focused on others that you've lost touch with your own wants.

Start with: "What did I enjoy before kids?" or "What sounds restful right now — even if I can't do it?"

Or just sit in silence. The activity matters less than the boundary.

### "My partner doesn't support my self-care"

This is a harder problem beyond this curriculum. A few options:
- Start small: 10 minutes, not an hour
- Trade explicitly: "I'll take Saturday morning, you take Sunday morning"
- Lower the bar: self-care in small stolen moments (bathroom break, car before going inside)

If your partner actively undermines your rest, that's a relationship issue, not a self-empathy issue.

**If resentment keeps pointing toward load imbalance or feeling like you're not a team:**
This is common, and it's addressable. Try:
- A 10-minute weekly "logistics huddle" to surface what feels heavy
- One concrete request: "I need rest. Could you take bedtime tonight?"
- Naming the pattern, not the person: "I'm noticing I'm carrying a lot of the mental load"

See the **[Co-Parenting Guide](/parenting/companions/co-parenting-guide/)** for scripts on division of labor and partner dynamics.

### ND Adaptation: Body-Based Practices

If verbal self-empathy doesn't land, try body-based alternatives:

| Need | Body-based practice |
|------|---------------------|
| Rest | Lie flat, close eyes, even for 2 minutes |
| Pressure/grounding | Weighted blanket, tight hug, push against wall |
| Release | Shake your body, cold water on face, hard exhale |
| Space | Step outside, feel air on skin |
| Movement | Walk, stretch, any motion |

Do the body practice FIRST, then try naming feelings/needs if it helps.
