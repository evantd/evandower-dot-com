**Phase:** 1 — Regulated Parent, Safer Home  
**Duration:** 1 week minimum (repeat if needed)

## The One Thing

> **This week, you don't teach your kids anything new. You learn to notice brain states — theirs and yours.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. Just ask yourself throughout the day: "Flooded or receptive?"

---

## This Week Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill (internal only)** | Spot brain states — no new kid tools yet | Throughout day |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Hand-on-heart breath | 1-2 min, 3x/day |
| **3. Environment** | Reduce clutter in one hotspot | 20-30 min once |

### Good Enough for Step 1

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Ask "Flooded or receptive?" once today
- **1-2 minutes:** Do the Hand-on-Heart breath once
- **20-30 minutes once this week:** Do the One Hotspot task

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** (Track 2 is the best default) and call it a win.

*If you like paper, print the **Step 1 Quick Reference Card** and only use that this step.*

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

Your child's brain has two parts that matter right now:

- **Upstairs brain** (thinking, learning, cooperating) — Under construction until age 25
- **Downstairs brain** (survival, fight/flight/freeze) — Fully operational from birth

When a child is **flooded** (screaming, hitting, melting down), their upstairs brain goes *offline*. They literally cannot:
- Hear your logic
- Learn from consequences  
- Make good choices

**This isn't defiance. It's neuroscience.**

The same is true for you. When YOU'RE flooded, your own upstairs brain goes offline. You can't parent well from survival mode.

### What This Changes

Once you internalize "flooded = can't learn," you stop:
- Explaining during meltdowns (waste of breath)
- Expecting cooperation from a flooded kid
- Feeling like a failure when logic doesn't work

You start:
- Waiting for the right moment
- Keeping yourself regulated first
- Reducing conflict by 30-50% (really)

## Track 1 – Child Skill (Internal Only): Spotting Brain States

### What to Look For

| State | Signs in Kids | Signs in You |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Flooded** | Screaming, hitting, rigid body, glazed eyes, irrational demands, "wrong-shaped pasta" level upset, **OR suddenly very quiet/blank/shutdown** | Raised voice, clenched jaw, racing heart, "I can't handle this," urge to yell or flee. **If you *look* calm but feel like you might explode, that's flooded too (masking).** |
| **Receptive** | Calmer body, can make eye contact, can hear you, responds to questions | Breathing normally, thinking clearly, can speak calmly |

### The Practice

**Every time chaos starts, ask silently:**

1. "Flooded or receptive?" (about them)
2. "Flooded or okay-enough?" (about me)

That's the whole skill this week. Just notice. Don't try to fix anything differently yet.

### Age Adaptations

**For 2-year-olds (twins):**
- Flooded looks like: Screaming, throwing, hitting, going rigid, complete shutdown
- They can't tell you they're flooded — you read bodies
- "Receptive" might only last 30 seconds — that's normal

**For 6-year-old:**
- Flooded also includes: Verbal irrationality, "it's not FAIR," dramatic escalation, **joking/silliness that's "too much," baby talk, hiding, or going very quiet**
- Can sometimes tell you "I'm upset" if not too far gone
- May need space OR closeness — follow their lead

**Twin dynamics:**
- One twin's meltdown may instantly flood the other — assume both are flooded if one is screaming

### If Someone is Flooded

**Your only job is safety and calming. Not teaching.**

- Say very little (words don't compute)
- Stay calm yourself (co-regulation)
- Keep everyone physically safe
- Wait

Think: **"Wait now, teach later."**

The teaching happens AFTER the meltdown, not during. (We'll get there in future weeks.)

> **Buddhist Lens (Optional):** This is *mindful awareness* (sati) — simply knowing what's happening as it happens. "Flooded or receptive?" is a micro-mindfulness practice. And when you pause before reacting, you're practicing *equanimity* — being a mountain while weather changes around you. See [Buddhist Lens](/parenting/companions/buddhist-lens/) for more.
>
> For ND nervous systems, "being the mountain" might also mean using earplugs, dimming the lights, or stepping away briefly to regulate yourself before you can be present again.

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Hand-on-Heart Breath

**Time:** 1-2 minutes, 3x/day  
**Setup:** Set 3 phone alarms (morning, afternoon, evening)

### The Practice

1. Hand on your chest (or heart)
2. Inhale for 4 counts
3. Exhale for 6-8 counts (longer out-breath activates calm)
4. Silently say: **"I'm a good parent having a hard moment."**

### Why This Specific Practice

- **Hand on heart:** Triggers self-compassion response (proven in research)
- **Longer exhale:** Activates parasympathetic nervous system (calming)
- **The mantra:** Reframes from "I'm failing" to "This is hard and I'm doing it"

### ND Adaptation

> **ND** = neurodivergent (autistic, ADHD, sensory processing differences, PDA profile, etc.). This curriculum works for all kids, but we're designing especially with ND kids and ND parents in mind.

If the mantra feels fake or uncomfortable:
- Try: "This is hard. Most parents struggle with this."
- Or just: "Breathe."
- Or skip words entirely — the breath is what matters

If heart focus is hard or activating (trauma, interoception difficulties):
- Press your feet firmly into the floor, OR
- Press your hands together hard
- ...while you breathe. Body pressure can help your brain calm.

**If alarms annoy you or you ignore them:**
- Stack the breath onto things you already do:
  - After you pee
  - When you close the fridge
  - When you buckle car seats
- Or tie it to one daily cue: "Whenever I hear a kid scream, I take ONE breath before moving."

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: One Hotspot

**Time:** 20-30 minutes once this week  
**Goal:** Reduce visual chaos in ONE area

### The Task

1. Pick one "hotspot" — a cluttered area that triggers you or the kids:
   - Toy zone
   - Entryway
   - Kitchen counter
   - Playroom corner

2. Remove or box up **1/3 of what's there**
   - Start with obvious trash, broken/outgrown items, and toys they rarely touch
   - Don't organize — remove
   - Kids don't need a big conversation about it. If your child is very attached or anxious about their things, say the toys are "on vacation" in a box
   - Store in closet, garage, or donate pile

3. Test: Could your 6-year-old tidy this area in 5 minutes?

### Why This Matters

- Visual clutter raises baseline stress for ND brains
- Fewer toys = fewer conflicts about toys
- Simpler space = easier transitions
- You're reducing the number of "triggers" in the environment

### If This Feels Overwhelming

Just do ONE surface. Kitchen counter. Entry table. One shelf. 10 minutes max.

If this task triggers shame, shrink it further: clear one shelf, not a room. Or skip it this week entirely — the brain-state skill is what matters most.

## Sibling Twist

When the kids fight this week, your only question is:

> **"Is this dangerous or just annoying?"**

- **Dangerous:** Hitting to hurt, contact with head/face, choking, biting hard, using objects as weapons, any risk of serious injury → Intervene immediately
- **Annoying:** Yelling, tattling, light pushing, "he touched my stuff" level conflict → Practice observing brain states instead of rushing in

Notice:
- Who's flooded? Who's receptive?
- Can anyone hear you right now?
- What happens if you wait 30 seconds?

You're not ignoring them — you're gathering data. (Sibling strategies come later.)

> We'll build more sibling tools in Step 11. For now, just sort: dangerous vs annoying.

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> You automatically think "flooded or receptive?" before responding to chaos — at least half the time.

Not 100%. Not even 70%. Just... it's becoming a habit. You catch yourself mid-reaction and pause.

If that's not happening after a week, stay on Step 1. There's no rush.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "If I just wait, am I rewarding bad behavior?"

No. When a child is flooded, the **learning part of the brain is offline**.

- Waiting doesn't reward the behavior — it just waits for the brain to come back online
- Teaching and boundaries **still happen**, just **later, when they can stick** (future weeks)
- You're not ignoring them — you're recognizing what's neurologically possible right now

**Safety and calming first. Teaching later.**

### "I keep forgetting to check brain states"

Put sticky notes where meltdowns happen:
- On the fridge
- In the playroom
- On your bathroom mirror

Write: **"Flooded or receptive?"**

### "I check their state but forget my own"

Your state matters MORE. You can't co-regulate from flooded.

Try: Check yourself FIRST. "Am I okay-enough to handle this?"

**"Okay-enough" doesn't mean calm or zen.** It just means: I can keep everyone safe and I'm unlikely to say/do something I'll really regret.

### "I notice we're both flooded. Now what?"

Safety first. Then:
- Step away briefly if kids are safe
- Hand on heart, one breath
- Return when you're at "okay-enough"

It's okay if this takes a few minutes. It's okay if you're not perfect.

### "My 6-year-old asks why I'm acting differently"

Simple: "I'm practicing taking breaths when things get hard. It helps my brain calm down."

You're modeling. That IS the teaching.

### "Everything is on fire and I can't do any of this"

See the [Emergency Mode Guide](/parenting/companions/emergency-mode-guide/). When life explodes (illness, crisis, sleep collapse), your only job is safety, co-regulation, and self-compassion. The rest can wait.
