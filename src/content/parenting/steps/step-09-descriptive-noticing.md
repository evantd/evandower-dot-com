title: "Descriptive Noticing (Replacing Praise)"
step: 9
phase: 3
phaseName: "Cooperation Without Coercion"
---

**Phase:** 3 — Cooperation Without Coercion  
**Duration:** 1 week minimum (repeat if needed)

---

## The One Thing

> **This step, you replace "good job!" with describing what you actually see.**

That's it. If you're overwhelmed, stop reading here. When you feel the urge to praise, describe instead: "You did it. You got your shoes on."

Everything from Step 8 (choices and playful invitations) stays in play — this step you add *how* you talk about what they do.

In this curriculum, we're slowly phasing out praise/rewards as the main way to motivate kids. This step is your first big swap **around praise and rewards**: information instead of evaluation.

> **Remember the order:**
> 1. Check brain states — flooded or receptive? (Step 1)
> 2. Connect first, name & validate feelings (Steps 2, 5)
> 3. Co-regulate / time-in if needed (Step 6)
> 4. THEN: this step's tool

## This Step Has 3 Tracks

| Track | What | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| **1. Child Skill** | Replace evaluations with descriptions | Throughout day |
| **2. Parent Practice** | Replace one "good job" per day with a description | 1-2 min |
| **3. Environment** | Build consistent bedtime routine with stories | 20-30 min once |

**If you only have...**
- **10 seconds:** Describe one thing you see your child do today instead of evaluating it
- **1-2 minutes:** Catch yourself before "good job!" and describe what they did instead
- **20-30 minutes once this step:** Lock in your bedtime routine

You do **not** have to do all 3 tracks. If life is intense, pick **one** (Track 2 is the smallest shift) and call it a win.

## Why This Matters

### The Science (30-second version)

"Good job!" feels supportive, but it has hidden costs:

- **It's evaluative** — kids learn to look to you for approval
- **It's vague** — they don't know what they did well
- **It can feel like pressure** — "Am I still 'good' if I don't do it next time?" (For PDA kids, even praise can feel like pressure to perform again.)
- **It can fuel masking and perfectionism** — especially for ND kids who already feel "too much" or "not enough," praise can make them perform for approval and hide their real selves

Descriptions work differently:

- **They're information** — kids learn what mattered
- **They build intrinsic motivation** — the focus is the action, not your approval
- **They feel specific** — "You noticed I did THAT"

**This isn't about being cold or withholding.** You can still be warm, enthusiastic, and proud. You're just adding information to your warmth. Think of it as **warmth + information**, instead of **warmth + judgment**.

You don't have to erase "good job" from your vocabulary. You're just building a new default: **describing first, praising less.**

### What This Changes

Once you internalize "describe, don't evaluate," you stop:
- Reflexively saying "good job" to everything
- Creating approval-seeking patterns
- Accidentally teaching that your evaluation is what matters

You start:
- Noticing specific things your kid does
- Communicating that YOU noticed
- Building their sense of competence (not just compliance)

## Track 1 – Child Skill: Descriptive Noticing

You've already practiced this in Step 4 as "sportscasting" during special time. This step you'll start using the same describing-instead-of-praising pattern all day, not just in play.

### The Formula

1. **Describe the action** — What did they do?
2. **Describe the effect** — What happened as a result?
3. **(Optional, 6-year-old+) Name a character trait** — What quality does this show?

**Even just Step 1 is a win.** If you only remember "say what they did," that's enough for this step.

### Translation Examples

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Good sharing!" | "You gave your sister the toy. She smiled so big." |
| "Good job cleaning!" | "You put all the cars in the bin. Now we can find them tomorrow." |
| "Good drawing!" | "You used a lot of blue. I see you drew circles here." |
| "Good listening!" | "You stopped when I asked. That made getting ready faster." |
| "Good eating!" | "You tried the broccoli. Your body got some green stuff." |
| "You're so smart!" | "You figured out how that fits together. You kept trying." |

For food, ultra-neutral options work well:
- For 6-year-old: "You took one bite. You checked it out."
- For 2-year-old: "You licked it." (no comment on good/bad)

### The Tone

You can still be warm and enthusiastic. This isn't robotic.

"You DID it! You got your shoes on all by yourself!" (describing with delight)

vs.

"Good job with shoes!" (evaluating)

Both are warm. One gives information.

### Age Adaptations

**For 2-year-olds (twins):**

| Situation | Evaluative (avoid) | Descriptive (try) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| They share | "Good sharing!" | "You gave it! She has it now." |
| They use potty | "Good job!" | "You did it! Pee in the potty!" |
| They put on shoes | "Good job!" | "Shoes on! You did it!" |
| They stack blocks | "Good tower!" | "You put that one on top. It's so tall!" |

- Enthusiasm in TONE is great — "You DID it!"
- Keep descriptions very simple — just action + result
- No need for character words at this age

**For 6-year-old:**

| Situation | Evaluative (avoid) | Descriptive (try) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| She shares with siblings | "Good sharing!" | "You let Lila have a turn. She got to play too." |
| She finishes hard task | "Good job!" | "You stuck with it even when it was tricky. That's persistence." |
| She helps clean up | "Such a good helper!" | "You put the books away. Now we can find them." |
| She tries new food | "Good eating!" | "You tried something new. Your taste buds got new information." |

- More detailed observations welcome
- Optional: add a character trait ("That's persistence," "That shows patience")
- Character words help her build an internal vocabulary for her qualities

**Twin dynamics:**
- Describe what each twin did individually — avoid comparing
- "Lila put the blocks in. And you got the cars!"
- If one copies the other: just describe both actions

### ND Adaptation

**Language development varies** — if your child's receptive language is still developing, keep descriptions very short. "You did it!" with a smile is enough.

**Echolalia may be communication** — if they repeat "You gave your sister the toy!" that's not misbehavior, it's often processing or connecting. You can just nod or repeat back calmly.

**Accept unconventional responses** — they don't have to say "thank you" or look pleased. They heard you.

**If verbal praise is overwhelming** — some kids don't want attention called to their actions at all. Try:
- Quiet noticing: "I saw that." (calm, brief)
- Nonverbal: smile, thumbs up, small nod
- Later mention: "I noticed earlier you shared with Lila. That was kind."

**Silent noticing counts too.** If words feel like too much (for you or them), just soft eye contact or a nod is okay.

If one twin does nothing and just watches, you can still notice: "You're watching. You're checking it out."

## Track 2 – Parent Mini-Practice: Replace One "Good Job" Per Day

**Time:** 1-2 minutes awareness throughout day  
**Goal:** Catch yourself ONE time daily before the automatic "good job!" and try a description instead

### The Practice

1. Notice the urge to say "good job!" or "well done!" or "good girl/boy!"
2. Pause.
3. Ask yourself: "What did they actually DO?"
4. Describe that thing out loud.

### Why This Specific Practice

This is habit-replacement. "Good job" is deeply automatic for most of us. You're not eliminating it — just adding a new option.

One replacement per day is enough. You'll naturally do more as it gets easier.

It can be as short as: "You did it." or "You put it there."

If "good job" slips out first, you can still add a description after. That still builds the habit.

You don't have to sound excited. **Flat but accurate** is still connection.

### If It Feels Awkward

That's normal. The first few times feel weird. The words might not come easily.

Keep going. By the end of the step, you'll have a few phrases that feel natural.

### ND Adaptation

If this feels performative or scripted:
- You don't have to sound like a parenting book
- "You did the thing. Nice." counts.
- Deadpan descriptions are fine

If tracking "one per day" feels like pressure:
- Just notice when you say "good job." That's the awareness. No quota needed.

## Track 3 – Environment Mini-Project: Lock In Bedtime Routine with Stories

**Time:** 20-30 minutes once this step  
**Goal:** Create a predictable, low-demand bedtime sequence that includes stories

### The Concept

Bedtime is often the hardest transition. Making it predictable reduces resistance.

#### ND Adaptation

For ND kids (and ND parents), bedtime can be extra hard because of **sensory stuff** (light, noise, scratchy pajamas) and **transition fatigue**. Part of this routine can be quietly adjusting those: softer lighting, comfy clothes, one predictable story.

### The Task

1. **Map your current bedtime** — What happens? In what order? Where do meltdowns occur?

2. **Choose a consistent sequence** — Same steps, same order, every night. Example:
   - Bath (or skip bath)
   - Jammies
   - Teeth
   - Stories (1-2 books or 10-15 min)
   - Song or quiet time
   - Lights out

3. **Add the "grit sandwich" (optional and skip it if it ramps them up):**
   - One good thing from today
   - One hard thing from today
   - One thing to look forward to tomorrow

   Some kids love this; others get more wired. If it seems to agitate her, drop the "hard thing" part or skip the sandwich entirely.

4. **Reduce decisions** — Pick jammies, books, etc. in advance. Fewer decisions at bedtime = fewer battles.

#### ND Adaptation

If holding all the steps in your head is hard, **write the routine down** or draw little icons and tape it near the bed. You can just point to the next step.

And if even one story feels impossible this step, **skip this track**. Track 2 (one description a day) is enough.

### Why Stories Matter

- Slows the nervous system
- Connection time (co-regulation)
- Predictable endpoint ("After stories, lights out")

### If Bedtime Is Currently a Disaster

Start smaller:
- Just add ONE story before lights out
- Don't overhaul the whole routine yet
- Build the story habit, then add structure around it

## Sibling Twist

Descriptive noticing works for sibling dynamics too:

**When they share or cooperate:**
- "You both made space. Now you're both playing."
- "You waited. She got her turn. Now it's yours."

**When one helps the other:**
- "You helped Lila. She figured it out."
- Not: "Good helping!" (too evaluative)
- If one child often ends up in the "helper" role, still describe **both** kids' actions so it doesn't become a one-sided identity.

**Avoid comparative descriptions:**
- Not: "You shared better than yesterday" or "Your sister did it faster"
- Just describe what THIS child did right now

**Describing the dynamic:**
- "You two figured that out together."
- "You made a deal. That worked."

---

## Mastery Indicator

**You've got this when:**

> Descriptions come more naturally than evaluations. You pause before praising — at least sometimes.

You don't have to eliminate "good job" entirely. You just have another option, and you use it. That's okay-enough.

If "good job" still pops out every time and you're not pausing at all, stay on Step 9.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "This feels cold or withholding"

Add warmth to your tone. Descriptions can be enthusiastic.

"Wow! You climbed all the way up! Look at you up there!" (describing with delight)

You're not removing warmth — just removing evaluation.

### "I keep forgetting and saying 'good job' anyway"

That's fine. Just notice after. You can even add: "Good job — you got all those blocks in there."

Over time, the description will come first.

### "My kid seems confused when I describe instead of evaluate"

They might be expecting "good job." Give it time.

Some kids take a week to adjust. They might even ask "Was that good?" You can say: "You tell me — how do you feel about it?"

### "I don't know what to describe"

Just say what you literally see.
- "You put the block on top."
- "You're using the red crayon."
- "You walked over here."

It doesn't have to be profound. Noticing is enough.

### "Why does this feel safer for ND kids?"

For many ND kids, **clear, specific information feels safer** than "good" or "bad." You're giving their nervous system something solid to hold onto.

### "What if grandparents/teachers still use stickers or time-out?"

See [External Adults Handout](/parenting/companions/external-adults-handout/) for scripts and "agree to disagree" ideas.
