title: "🚨 EMERGENCY MODE"
---

**When everything is on fire: illness, crisis, sleep collapse, overwhelm**

---

## ONLY TWO THINGS MATTER

### 1. Brain States
> "Flooded or receptive?" — for them AND you

If anyone is flooded → **wait now, teach later**

### 2. Co-Regulation
> Stay calm. Stay present. Stay close.

That's it. Silent presence counts.

For ND brains (yours or theirs), this might also mean: earplugs, dim lights, fewer words. Silence is allowed.

## DROP COMPLETELY ✂️

- ~~Environment projects~~
- ~~Special time expectations~~
- ~~Skill-building goals~~
- ~~Descriptive noticing practice~~
- ~~Problem-solving conversations~~
- ~~All curriculum steps~~

## YOUR ONLY JOB

```
Safety + Co-regulation + Self-compassion
```

**Surviving IS success.**

This is not a setback. This is life with young kids.

Skipping "special time" or forgetting scripts for weeks does not undo progress. Your nervous systems matter more than the curriculum.

## THE MANTRA

> **"I am a good parent having a very hard week."**

Or: *"Connect. That's all."*

## WHEN TO RETURN

**Signs you have capacity again:**
- You slept (even poorly) for 2+ nights
- You can think about next week without dread
- Kids are past acute illness/crisis
- You notice yourself wanting structure back

**How to re-enter:**
1. Start at Step 1 (brain states + pause)
2. Move faster through familiar steps
3. 70% standard still applies — imperfect is fine

> When you have a bit more capacity again but not enough for all 12 steps, see the [6-step Compact Path](/parenting/).
