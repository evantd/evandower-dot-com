title: "6-Step Compact Path"

**When you have some capacity but not enough for all 12 steps**

> If even this 6-step path feels like too much, use [Emergency Mode](/parenting/companions/emergency-mode-guide/) instead.

## The Survival Curriculum

If life explodes and 12 steps feels impossible, here's the **6-step survival curriculum:**

| Step | Focus | From |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Brain states + parent pause | [Step 1](/parenting/steps/step-01-brain-states/) |
| 2 | Connect before correct | [Step 2](/parenting/steps/step-02-connect-first/) |
| 3 | Naming feelings | [Step 5](/parenting/steps/step-05-naming-feelings/) |
| 4 | Choices + play | [Step 8](/parenting/steps/step-08-choices-play/) |
| 5 | Sturdy leadership | [Step 10](/parenting/steps/step-10-sturdy-leadership/) |
| 6 | Repair | [Step 12](/parenting/steps/step-12-problem-solving-repair/) |

## What You're Skipping

- Special time depth (Step 4)
- Full simplicity project (Step 3)
- Descriptive noticing refinement (Step 9)
- Sibling ladder details (Step 11)
- Emotion coaching depth (Step 6)
- Description & information skills (Step 7)

These are all valuable, but they're not essential for survival.

## When to Use This

- Life is in crisis mode but not full Emergency Mode
- You're returning from Emergency Mode and need a bridge
- 12 steps feels overwhelming right now
- You want the core toolkit without the refinements

---

## When to Return to Full Curriculum

- Crisis has passed
- You're hitting ~70% on these 6 steps
- You notice gaps (sibling conflicts, missing connection time)
- You have capacity for one more thing

Return to the [full curriculum](/parenting/) when ready. There's no rush.
