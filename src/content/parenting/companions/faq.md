Quick answers to things the curriculum doesn't cover in depth.

## Sleep

**Night-wakings with twins are brutal. Why doesn't this curriculum address sleep?**

Sleep is its own domain. This curriculum gives you tools for connection, regulation, and cooperation — but not a sleep plan.

**What to know:**
- If nights are a disaster, prioritize YOUR rest over everything in this curriculum
- Same tools apply at 3am: co-regulation, naming feelings, calm presence
- No need for special scripts — use what you know, just quieter
- Permission to not "teach" anything at 3am — just get through it

**If you want a full approach:** Look for resources aligned with this philosophy (connection-based, no cry-it-out). Oh Crap! I Have a Toddler (Jamie Glowacki) and The Happy Sleeper (Turgeon & Wright) are often recommended.

**The mantra:** Surviving the night is success.

## Toileting

**Why doesn't this curriculum cover potty training?**

Toilet learning is a huge topic that deserves its own treatment. The same principles apply:
- Brain states first — can they hear you?
- Co-regulation, not punishment
- Descriptive information, not shame
- Natural outcomes (wet clothes feel uncomfortable)

**What to know:**
- This curriculum doesn't give step-by-step potty guidance
- Regression during toilet learning is normal and doesn't mean the curriculum isn't working
- Avoid power struggles — readiness matters more than method

**If you want a full approach:** Oh Crap! Potty Training (Jamie Glowacki) aligns reasonably well with this philosophy. Your pediatrician may also have recommendations.

## Asynchronous Development

**What if my child seems "behind" or very uneven compared to peers?**

Neurodivergent development is often asynchronous — a child might be 6 in some domains and 10 in others. This isn't a problem to fix; it's a pattern to understand. The curriculum's ND adaptations (see the summary in `curriculum.md`) and both the Buddhist and Waldorf lens companions emphasize patterns over rigid stages. If your child doesn't match typical developmental timelines, nothing is wrong.

## What About [Topic Not Covered]?

This curriculum focuses on the core parent-child dynamic. It doesn't cover:
- Food/eating (picky eating, meal battles)
- Medical needs (chronic illness, developmental delays requiring specialists)
- School challenges (homework, bullying, academic struggles)
- Technology/screen time limits in detail

For these, the same foundation applies: brain states → connection → cooperation. But you may need specialized resources for the specifics.
