## This Week's Skill

**Name and validate feelings before fixing**

*Acknowledge feelings first. Don't rush to solutions.*

## The Sequence

| Step | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| 1. Name it | "You're frustrated" |
| 2. Validate it | "Of course — you really wanted that" |
| 3. Don't fix yet | Just let the feeling be heard |
| 4. Wait | Watch for body to soften |

**If words are hard:** "Something's wrong. I'm here."

*ND note: A silent nod and staying nearby counts. Presence matters more than perfect words.*
