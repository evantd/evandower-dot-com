### The Request Test

**How do you react when they say no?**

| Your Reaction | What It Was |
|---------------|-------------|
| Punish, guilt-trip, withdraw | DEMAND |
| Get curious, negotiate, accept | REQUEST |

### What Makes a True Request

1. **Positive** — What you WANT (not what you don't want)
2. **Specific** — Concrete action they can do
3. **Present moment** — Doable now
4. **Okay with "no"** — No punishment follows

### Common Transformations

| Demand | Request |
|--------|---------|
| "Clean up NOW." | "Would you be willing to put the blocks away?" |
| "Say sorry!" | "Would you check if she's okay?" |
| "Stop crying." | "Can I sit with you?" |
| "Get your shoes on!" | "Can you get your shoes before we leave?" |

### When They Say No

1. Get curious: "What's going on?"
2. Problem-solve: "What would work for you?"
3. Accept: "Okay, not now."

### Your Daily Practice

Replace ONE demand with a true request. Notice what happens.
