## The Sibling Safety Ladder

| Level | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **1. Bickering** | IGNORE (but stay nearby). Think about your vacation or count 5 blue things. |
| **2. Heating Up** | SPORTSCASTER + LEAVE (see below) |
| **3. Possibly Dangerous** | SEPARATE. "Different rooms so bodies can cool down. You're not in trouble." |
| **4. Dangerous** | INTERVENE. Attend injured child. "People are not for hurting." |

For toddlers, you can ignore while staying in the same room.

---

## Dangerous vs Annoying

**Dangerous:** Hitting to hurt, head/face, choking, biting hard, weapons  
**Annoying:** Yelling, tattling, light pushing, "he touched my stuff"

---

## Level 2 Script

```
"I see two angry kids!"
"[Name] wanted ___. [Name] wanted ___."
"I have confidence you can figure this out."
LEAVE.
```

## Comparison Rewrites

| Don't Say | Do Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "Why can't you be like..." | Describe the behavior you want |
| "She's the wild one" | "She has a lot of energy" |
| "Same for everyone" | "Are you still hungry?" |

## When One Complains About Another

1. Acknowledge: "You're really upset with him."
2. Validate wish: "You wish he'd disappear sometimes!"
3. Don't defend or fix immediately

---

## Environment Task

Create **[6yo's name]'s protected space** — a shelf, drawer, or box twins can't access.

*"You don't have to share everything in this space."*

---

## Mastery

You ignore Level 1 bickering and step back from Level 2 — at least half the time. Not 100%!
