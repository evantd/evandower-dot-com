### Self-Empathy Check-In (2-5 min)

1. **Pause** — "Something's happening in me"
2. **Sensations** — Where in my body?
3. **Feeling** — Tired? Resentful? Hopeless?
4. **Need** — Rest? Appreciation? Autonomy? Space?
5. **Mourn** — "It makes sense I'm struggling. This is hard."
6. **Request** — One small thing I can do?

### Four Steps (Body-Based Alternative)

1. **Recognize** — "I'm suffering right now."
2. **Drop the story** — Let go of why/whose fault.
3. **Turn toward** — Feel it in your body. Where?
4. **Offer kindness** — Hand on heart. "I'm here."

### Should → Choose

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "I should be more patient" | "I want to be patient because connection matters to me" |
| "I have to make dinner" | "I choose to make dinner because I value feeding my family" |
| "I shouldn't yell" | "I want to find other ways to express frustration" |

### Anger Translation

1. Notice: "I'm angry"
2. Thought: "What am I telling myself?"
3. Need: "What do I actually need?"
4. Request: "What can I ask for?"

### Protect One Thing

Schedule ONE thing for yourself this week.  
Put it in your calendar.  
Tell someone it's non-negotiable.  
If derailed, reschedule within 24 hours.
