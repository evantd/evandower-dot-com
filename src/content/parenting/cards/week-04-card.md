## This Week's Skill

**10-15 min daily special time — they lead completely**

*Phone away, follow their lead, no teaching.*

**Good enough:** Special time with at least one child on at least 3 days.

---

## Special Time Rules

| You DO | You DON'T |
|--------|-----------|
| Follow their lead | Teach or correct |
| Sportscast (see below) | Evaluate ("Good job!") |
| Phone in another room | Ask leading questions |
| Warn before ending | End abruptly |

**Always okay:** Step in for safety, harm, or property damage.

---

## Sportscasting

Describe what you see — no judgment.

| Not This | This |
|----------|------|
| "Beautiful!" | "You're using blue." |
| "Good job!" | "You built it tall." |
| "What color is that?" | "You picked the green one." |

## Non-Verbal Options

- Sit nearby (no agenda)
- Mirror their expressions
- Chase / peekaboo
- Be bumbling and incompetent (they direct)
- Parallel play (do what they do) — this still counts as special time

---

## Ending Special Time

1. "Two more minutes"
2. "Special time is all done"
3. Clear next activity

---

## After-School Ritual

1. Arrival cue (shoes off)
2. Same snack spot  
3. 15-30 min decompress (no demands)

**Don't ask:** "How was your day?" — wait until later.

---

## Mastery

Follow their lead 15 minutes without directing or correcting.
