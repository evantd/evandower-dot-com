### Plan B: The 7 Steps

1. **Empathy:** "What's going on for you about [problem]?"
2. **Dig deeper:** "Tell me more..."
3. **Reflect:** "So you're saying..."
4. **Your concern:** "The thing is, when [problem], I [your concern]."
5. **Invitation:** "I wonder if we can figure this out together?"
6. **Brainstorm:** Write ALL ideas — don't evaluate yet
7. **Evaluate & try:** "Which might work?" Pick one for 3-5 days.

**Then:** Reassess. "How did it go? Adjust?"

### Key Mindset

- "Won't" → "Can't yet" (what skill is lagging?)
- "My solution" → "Our solution"
- Genuine curiosity > hidden agenda

### For Twins (2-year-olds)

- Too young for Plan B
- Continue: micro-choices, practice runs, environmental support
- YOU observe patterns and solve on their behalf

### Problem-Solving Time

- 10 min/week, same time
- "Anything hard this week?"
- Pick ONE thing to work on
- Review last week's plan
