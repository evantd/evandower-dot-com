## This Week's Skill

**Describe and inform instead of commanding**

*Invite cooperation. Don't demand obedience.*

---

## The Formula

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| 1. Describe what you see | "I see bare feet" |
| 2. Give information | "We leave in 5 minutes" |
| 3. One word (once established) | "Shoes." |

---

## Transformations

| Command | Description/Info |
|---------|------------------|
| Put on your shoes! | I see bare feet. We leave in 5 min. |
| Clean up! | When toys are in basket, we can find them. |
| Stop running! | Inside is for walking. |
| Be quiet! | The baby is sleeping. |

---

## Age Scripts

| 2-Year-Olds | 6-Year-Old |
|-------------|------------|
| "Shoes go on feet!" (+ point) | "I notice you're not dressed. We leave at 7:30." |
| "Food stays on plate." | "Your plate is still on the table." (wait) |

## Key Principles

```
SAY LESS
WAIT MORE
10-30 SEC PROCESSING TIME
GET CLOSE BEFORE SPEAKING
USE VISUALS WHEN POSSIBLE
```

You will still give commands sometimes. That's okay.

---

## Visual Support

Create ONE visual for a recurring issue:
- Picture schedule for morning routine
- Photo of where coat goes
- Checklist by the door

**Post at kid-eye level.**

---

## Command Audit

Track commands for one day. Replace ONE with description/info.

---

## Sibling Fights

> "I see two kids who both want the same toy."

Then wait. Let them problem-solve.

---

## Mastery

You catch yourself before commanding and rephrase — at least once a day.
