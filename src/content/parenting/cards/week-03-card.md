## This Week's Focus

**Simplify environment — no new kid skills**

*Let the calmer space do the work.*

You don't have to finish this whole card. If you're wiped: just remove one annoying toy and watch your kids play for 30 seconds. That counts.

---

## Toy Reduction

Remove 50-75% of toys (or until 5-min cleanup is possible):

| Keep | Remove |
|------|--------|
| Favorites + open-ended | Broken, outgrown |
| Blocks, art, dress-up | Battery toys, duplicates |
| Books (rotate) | Conflict-causing toys |

Do it during nap/screen time. Store in rotation boxes.

## One Visual Rhythm

Pick ONE routine:
- Morning
- Evening  
- After-school

Make it visual: 3-5 pictures in order (photos or drawings).

---

## Parent Practice

Notice kids playing 30-60 seconds without intervening.

*Just observe. No fixing.*

---

## Sibling Fights

Fewer toys = fewer fights.

Toys that still cause conflict → "vacation" (remove them).

---

## Mastery

Environment feels calmer. Fewer toy conflicts.
