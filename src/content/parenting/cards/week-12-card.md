5. Pick one to try
6. Check back next day

## Practice Runs (2yo Twins)

| Skill | Script |
|-------|--------|
| Taking turns | "Let's practice! Say 'your turn' and give it to me. Now 'my turn'!" |
| Using words | "When you want it, say 'mine!' Let's practice!" |
| Transitions | "When the music stops, we walk to the car. Let's try!" |

*30 seconds, make it fun, repeat often*

## Repair After Rupture

```
1. OWN IT: "I yelled. That wasn't okay."
2. NAME FEELING: "I was really overwhelmed."
3. LOVE + PLAN: "You're a good kid. I'm working on it."
```

**For 2yo:** "Mama got too loud. I'm sorry. I love you." [Offer hug]

## What NOT to Do

❌ "I'm sorry, BUT if you hadn't..."  
❌ Excessive guilt or groveling  
❌ "You made me yell"  
❌ Demanding they accept the apology

---

## Weekly Check-In (10-15 min)

Three questions, everyone answers:

1. "What went well this week?"
2. "What was hard?"
3. "One thing to do differently?"

---

## Mastery

Pick **one**: problem-solving OR a repair OR a check-in. That's enough for this week.

You can repair after rupture — apologize simply, without excessive guilt, and move on.
