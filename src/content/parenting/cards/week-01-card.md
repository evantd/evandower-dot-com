## This Week's Skill

**Notice brain states — don't teach during meltdowns**

*No new strategies for the kids this week — just noticing and waiting.*

---

## The Question

| For Them | For You |
|----------|---------|
| Flooded or receptive? | Flooded or okay-enough? |

---

## Flooded Signs

**Kids:** Screaming, hitting, rigid, glazed eyes, irrational, **OR suddenly quiet/blank**  
**You:** Racing heart, clenched jaw, urge to yell (or calm outside, exploding inside)

---

## If Anyone is Flooded

```
SAY LESS
STAY CALM  
KEEP SAFE
WAIT
```

**"Wait now, teach later."**

*If eye contact or touch is too much for either of you, just stay nearby. Presence counts.*

---

## Daily Practice (3x/day)

1. Hand on heart
2. Breathe in 4, out 6-8
3. "I'm a good parent having a hard moment."

---

## Environment Task

Remove 1/3 from ONE hotspot this week.

---

## Sibling Fights

**Dangerous or just annoying?**

- Dangerous → intervene
- Annoying → observe brain states, wait

---

## Mastery

You think "flooded or receptive?" before reacting — at least half the time.
