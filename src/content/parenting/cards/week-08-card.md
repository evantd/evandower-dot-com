## This Week's Skills

**Replace power struggles with choices and play**

*Both options must be acceptable to you. Silly beats loud.*

**ND hack:** Both options must be acceptable to you, and **never more than 2**.

---

## Choice Formula

| Instead of commands | Offer two options |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Put shoes on!" | "Shoes first or jacket first?" |
| "Time for bath!" | "Walk to bath or hop like a bunny?" |

---

## Playful Moves

| Move | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| **Robot voice** | Routine resistance |
| **Whisper** | They're tuning you out |
| **Incompetence** | "I can't find my coat!" |
| **Race** | Transitions |
| **Song** | Anything |

## If Choices Don't Work

- ND brain overwhelmed? → Limit to **2 options max**
- PDA kid? → **Skip choices** most of the time; playful invitations work better
- They're flooded? → Wait first, choice later

---

## Daily Practice

Replace ONE power struggle with play today. Notice what happens.

---

## Environment Task

Audit A days (arousing) vs C days (calming).  
Add a C half-day after your busiest days.

---

## Sibling Application

- Same choice for both twins avoids comparison
- Race them against YOU, not each other
- Silly voice defuses toy battles

---

## Mastery

You have 2-3 playful moves you reach for naturally — at least sometimes.
