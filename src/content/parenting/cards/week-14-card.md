### The Role Trap

| Label (Avoid) | Description (Use) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "She IS stubborn" | "She's holding firm right now" |
| "He's the wild one" | "He has lots of energy today" |
| "She never shares" | "Sharing is hard for her today" |
| "He's my difficult child" | "He's having a hard time right now" |

**Add "today," "right now," or "in this moment."**

### 4 Ways to Free from Roles

1. **Show new picture:** Notice when they contradict the label
2. **New situations:** Create chances to act differently
3. **Overhear positives:** Let them hear you say something good
4. **Model:** Demonstrate instead of lecture

### Sibling Rules

- Never compare: "Why can't you be like..."
- Don't force 6-year-old into "helper" role
- Let each twin be multidimensional
- Describe current behavior, not permanent traits

### This Step's Environment Task

Start a "storehouse" — a list of moments that contradict each child's stuck role.
