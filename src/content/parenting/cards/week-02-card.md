## This Week's Skill

**Try to connect for up to ~2 minutes before teaching/fixing**

*Move toward, get low, say little — correction comes later.*

For some kids, quiet presence IS connection. Follow their cues.

---

## The Move

1. Move toward (not away)
2. Get low (their level)
3. Say little: "You're upset."
4. Wait ~2 min (or until calmer)
5. Then: "What happened?"

---

## Connect Sounds Like

| Not This | This |
|----------|------|
| "You can't hit!" | "You're so upset." |
| "Use your words!" | "Something's really hard." |
| "Why did you do that?" | "I'm here." |

## Mantras

```
CONNECT FIRST
TOWARD, NOT AWAY
```

Put sticky notes where meltdowns happen.

---

## Transition Cue

Pick ONE hard transition. Add ONE predictable cue (song, rhyme, timer, snack). Same cue every time.

---

## Sibling Fights

Connect to the complainer's feelings first:
- "You're upset about something with [sibling]."

Then investigate.

---

## Mastery

You feel the urge to correct — and pause anyway.
