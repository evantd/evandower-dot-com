## This Week's Skill

**Co-regulate during meltdowns. Time-in, not time-out.**

*Stay with them. Don't send them away when they need you most.*

---

## Emotion Coaching Sequence

| Step | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| 1. Name feeling | "You're so frustrated" |
| 2. Validate | "Of course you're upset" |
| 3. Set limit (if needed) | "And hitting isn't okay" |
| 4. Offer strategy | "Would you like to squeeze my hands?" |

## Co-Regulation Script

> "You're having such a hard time. I'm going to sit with you."

Stay nearby. Speak slowly. Wait.

---

## If They Need Space

> "I'll be right outside the door. You're safe."

*Check back. The message: space is okay, but I'm not leaving.*

Some kids calm best with space. That still counts as co-regulation if you stay available and check back.

## Yell-Less Plan

1. **Mantra:** "This is not an emergency"
2. **Reminders:** Sticky notes in trigger spots
3. **Escape route:** Water on face, step outside

## Calm Corner

Soft things + fidgets + headphones.

**Introduce when calm — not during meltdown.**

---

## Sibling Meltdowns

Don't coach both at once. Stabilize one, then the other.

---

## Mastery

You co-regulate during a meltdown at least sometimes — not fixing, just present.
