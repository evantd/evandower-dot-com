## This Week's Skill

**Replace "good job!" with describing what you see**

*You can still be warm and enthusiastic — just add information.*

---

## The Formula

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Describe action** | "You put all the cars in the bin." |
| **Describe effect** | "Now we can find them tomorrow." |
| **(6yo) Character word** | "That's persistence." |

If you forget the rest, **Step 1 (describe action)** is enough.

Silent nod or gentle eye contact also counts.

---

## Quick Translations

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Good sharing!" | "You gave sister the toy. She smiled." |
| "Good job!" | "You did it! You got your shoes on!" |
| "Good drawing!" | "You used lots of colors." |
| "You're so smart!" | "You figured it out. You kept trying." |

## Age Notes

**2yo twins:** Enthusiasm in TONE. "You DID it!" Simple descriptions only.

**6yo:** More detail okay. Add character words: "That's patience."

---

## ND Adaptations

- Short descriptions fine: "You did it!" with a smile
- Quiet noticing: "I saw that." (brief)
- Nonverbal: smile, thumbs up, nod

---

## Daily Practice

Replace ONE "good job" per day with a description.

The pause before praising = the skill.

---

## Environment Task

Lock in bedtime routine with stories.  
Same steps, same order, every night.

Optional "grit sandwich" for 6yo: good thing, hard thing, tomorrow preview.

If even one story feels impossible this week, **skip this track**. Track 2 is enough.

---

## Mastery

Descriptions come more naturally than evaluations. You pause before praising — at least sometimes.
