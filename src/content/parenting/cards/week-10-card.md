## This Week's Skill

**Hold a boundary without yelling or caving. Stay present.**

*Their upset doesn't mean you did something wrong.*

---

## "Two Things Are True"

> "You want ___. AND it's time to ___."

| Situation | Script |
|-----------|--------|
| Leaving park | "You want to stay. AND it's time to go." |
| Screen time | "You wish you could watch more. AND screens are done." |
| Sharing | "You want to keep it. AND sister gets a turn." |

Use **AND**, not BUT. Both things are real.

---

## "I Won't Let You"

> "I won't let you [hit]. I'm here with you."

For safety limits. Calm, clear, no repeating.

If this phrase escalates your child, skip it and use the ND adaptations below.

---

## The Sequence

```
1. STATE calmly (once)
2. ACT (move, remove, redirect)  
3. STAY present ("I'm here")
4. DON'T explain during meltdown
5. REPAIR after
```

---

## ND Adaptations

- **PDA:** Use "I'm going to help your body calm down" instead of "I won't let you"
- **Transitions:** 5-10 min warnings before limits kick in
- **Shutdown:** Also flooded — stay present, give time

---

## Daily Practice

Pick your wobbliest boundary. Hold it once this week.

---

## Environment Task

**One in, one out.** New toy in → old toy out.  
Keep the simplicity from earlier weeks.

---

## Sibling Application

- Same rule for both: "I won't let anyone hit anyone."
- Stay neutral — don't need to know who started it
- Calm first, investigate later (if both flooded)

---

## Mastery

You hold a boundary without yelling or caving — at least sometimes. And you stay present through the upset.
