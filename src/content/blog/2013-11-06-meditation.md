**Wednesday morning: 30 minutes**

I was up late last night editing audio. For my 30th birthday, I asked people to leave me a voicemail saying things they like about me. Then I downloaded them, put them on my mp3 player, and started listening to them about once a day. I just recently recorded that kind of message for myself, but they turned out really quiet. As long as I was editing them to fix the volume, I figured I might as well do the same for the rest of them. It took a surprisingly long time, but I listened to them in the car this morning, and I never had to really crank the volume up (which I find adds an obnoxious buzzing sound), so it was totally worth it.

All that means I got to bed late, and thus woke up late. I meditated anyway, though, even prioritizing it over showering. (I smell just fine.) I did an Anapanasati-style breathing meditation, which I find is largely about paying attention to myself in increasingly subtle ways. I kind of wanted to follow it up with an Upekkha Bhavana meditation, but I figured I had better not push it on what felt like my first day back on track, and I felt the need to head in to work.
