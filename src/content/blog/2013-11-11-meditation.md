**Monday morning: 30 minutes**

Dan and Nancy came over to meditate this morning for the urban retreat. I did some Anapanasati for the first 20 minutes, and Metta Bhavana for the last 10. I really enjoyed it. I enjoy the structured introspection of Anapanasati, and find that it is a foundational tool of self-metta for me, which makes the Metta Bhavana go much more smoothly. I'm excited to be doing so much meditation this week, as it will likely be about twice each day for the retreat.

**Monday night: 30 minutes at the center**

Sleepy.
