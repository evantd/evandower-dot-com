Honestly, wanting my own personal domain name (evandower.com) was a big part of the reason I made this site.

It also fills a niche that social networks sort of don't for me. In particular, social networks such as Facebook encourage us to keep it pretty darn short. That works for quick amusing tidbits, but not for things that I really care about and want to give the attention I think they deserve. Sometimes I want to write a few pages about something that happened in my life, an experience I had meditating, or something I have a strong opinion about. Plus, this lets me organize things a bit. Some people probably only want to hear about what's going on in my life (The Buzz), some might only be interested in my Rants, and occasionally someone might be interested in my Meditation Log, though just being interested in my Meditation Insights seems more likely.

I might fill in the past week or so of meditation to get things started, and I definitely have life stuff to talk about, since I recently got rid of my mortgage, turned 31, and graduated from massage school. And you better believe I have some rants stored up in my reserve. So stay tuned for what I hope to be regular, interesting, and pleasant-to-read updates.
