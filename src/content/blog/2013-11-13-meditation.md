**Wednesday morning: 30 minutes**

I took the same approach as the last few days. I was a little less concentrated than the previous mornings, since I needed to keep a hand on Elise to make sure she didn't lick her leg, but still a really positive overall experience. I feel like I've found a process that works really well for me, at least for now. And meditating twice a day has been awesome! Thanks very much to Dan & Nancy for coming over each morning and helping to make it happen!

**Wednesday evening: 30 minutes at the center**

Super distracted. I mostly spent the time thinking about my friend Jen, who's stressing about job interviews, and how I could explain the different AWS database offerings to her at an appropriately high level.
