**Tuesday: 25 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes at mitra study**

Two days in a row longer than 15 minutes! Standard for me is 5-15 minutes. I think the meditation during mitra study was the first time it had ever occurred to me to include my therapist. I think it had never come up before because she doesn't fit into any groups in my life, and that tends to be how I come up with people. Anyway, she came up when I was expending my metta out, touching on anybody that came into my consciousness. I was filled with gratitude that I don't think I had previously recognized to myself or expressed to her.

After I got home, I looked at Facebook, and a friend had posted some amusing (yet sensitive) comics about depression. I don't think people post about depression unless they experience it, so I felt compassion for her. I was also moved by the sentiments expressed, to the point that I teared up a little bit.
