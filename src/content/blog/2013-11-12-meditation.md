**Tuesday morning: 30 minutes**

Another lovely morning meditation with Dan & Nancy. I managed to speed things up a bit, so that I went through an abbreviated Anapanasati in the first 12 minutes, then did the self-metta stage of the Metta Bhavana for 6 minutes, and finished up with the other 4 stages of the Metta Bhavana in the last 12 minutes. I was really pleased with how well it seemed to go, and the challenge of doing it quickly.

**Tuesday evening: 30 minutes at the center**

I led this one, which can be a little distracting. I went with 2 minutes of prep, 7 of self-metta, 7 of friend metta, 4 each for the last 3 stages, and then 2 minutes of just sitting. I got a great compliment from Dan that he particularly enjoyed how I led it.
