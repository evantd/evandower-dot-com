Over a year ago, my therapist introduced me to Schema Therapy. Taking the "Young Schema Questionnaire" was pretty much the first contact I had with it. It immediately became my favorite psychological test, because it made me feel like somebody understood me. Most psychological tests just tell you if they think you're depressed or anxious or what-have-you, but this one seems to capture much more precise feelings and issues, providing concise words for amorphous feelings.

I recently made a web-based version of the test. You should take it, partly because I'm interested to hear if you find it helpful, and partly because it took me about 12 hours to put it together.
