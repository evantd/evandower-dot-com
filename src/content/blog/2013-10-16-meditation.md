**Wednesday: 50 minutes**

When I meditate these days, I set a bell to ring every 5 minutes, just to provide a rough idea of how long I've been sitting without much interruption. That is, I don't plan on sitting for a certain amount of time. I think I was expected to sit for about 30 minutes, but it felt like good things were happening, and progress was being made, so I just kept sitting for what ended up being 50 minutes. After checking in with myself, I did an anapanasati-style breathing meditation up through the 6th contemplation (pleasure). I thought that it made sense to insert the metta bhavana there, and then I continued with the anapanasati through the 8th contemplation (calming mental processes).

During the metta portion, I had a feeling of being very small in a very large space while simultaneously suffusing the entire space. The Facebook post about depression also came to mind and as part of the whole experience of sadness, compassion, metta, and hope, tears rolled down my face.

In the last couple anapanasati contemplations about mental processes, something that had happened before came up again more strongly. I typically say that I think in words. When I read, I hear each word in my head. Sometimes, when I'm thinking to myself, I catch muscles in my tongue and throat hinting at the words I'm telling myself. When a thought distracted me, I used to finish the thought/sentence and try to let it go. It didn't work very well, so I tried just cutting it off right in the middle, and I found that it worked much better. It also made me realize that I already knew what the thought was. The only thing I had interrupted was narrating it to myself. Narrating my thoughts to myself (instead of just experiencing them) is something of a compulsion for me, and I don't really know how I would reason without it. In these last couple stages I took on the practice of experiencing the thought itself rather than narrating it and just experiencing that abstraction of it. This will take a lot more practice ;-)
