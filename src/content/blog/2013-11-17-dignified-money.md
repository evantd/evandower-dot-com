Earned income is taxed at up to 39.6% once you start making a lot of money. It starts at a minimum of 10%, and that's only for people who are pretty poor. Anyone making a living wage pays at least 15%, and to have any kind of sense of security requires getting into at least the 25% bracket.

Meanwhile, long term capital gains are taxed *at most* 20% (and never more than the rate for the taxpayer's bracket). That means people who have enough money to invest are paying a higher rate for their earned income than for their capital gains, or, as I like to call it, unearned income.

This doesn't make sense to me. The unearned income of capital gain is money that a person gets just for having money to spare. It's money that someone gets precisely because they don't need it. Earned income comes from sweat and toil. It seems obvious to me that unearned income (capital gains) should be taxed at a higher rate than that of earned income (wages), or at least at the same rate.

Here's my very simple proposal: include capital gains as part of "adjusted gross income", the number on which normal income tax is calculated. For short term gains, tack on an additional ten or twenty percent. Short term gains are not really investment but what I would call speculation, and I think it contributes to economic instability.

Unearned income is just plain less dignified than earned income, so it should be taxed more.
