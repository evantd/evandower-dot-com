For the last few days, I meditated for 10, 15, and 20 minutes respectively. It's nice to see the trend, and I'm looking forward to feeling like I have time to sit longer. Before that, meditation was sporadic, but I often replaced meditation with other activities that gave me a sense of peace and accomplishment, so I'm pretty okay with that.
