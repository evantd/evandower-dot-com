I haven't been meditating very much lately. Assuming I get back into it, I think I can use getting sick as an excuse. I've mostly just been meditating at the center, and maybe one short meditation per week at home.

**Monday: 30 minutes**

For Mitra Study, we're supposed to do some Mudita Bhavana, and for therapy, I'm supposed to record a message to myself talking about things I like about myself. Earlier this week, I wrote a list of things to put in my message, and for part of my meditation this morning, I went over the list and talked to myself about it. I figure that counts as rejoicing in merits.
